OSI will celebrate its 20th Anniversary on February 3, 2018, during the opening day of FOSDEM 2018. The presentation will summarize the evolution of open source licences and the Open Source Definition (OSD) across two decades, explain why the concept of free open source software has grown in both relevance and popularity and explore trends for the third decade of open source.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Open source software is now ubiquitous, recognized across industries as a fundamental component to infrastructure, as well as a critical factor for driving innovation. Over the past twenty years, the OSI has worked to promote and protect open source software, development, and communities, championing software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the Open Source Definition (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement. The “open source” label was created at a strategy session held at the start of February 1998 in Mountain View, California. That same month, now almost twenty years ago, the OSI was founded as a general educational and advocacy organization to raise awareness and adoption for the application of free software in an open development process.                Some of the largest forces in business today — consumer-facing companies like Google and Facebook, business-facing companies like Salesforce and SUSE, companies outside the tech industry such as BMW, Capital One, and Zalando, even first-gen tech corporations like Microsoft and IBM — all increasingly depend on open source software. Governments too, including the European Union, France, India, the United Kingdom, the United States, and many others have discovered the benefits of open source software and development models. Successful collaborative development of software and infrastructure used by these organizations is enabled by the safe space created when they use their IP in new ways... to ensure an environment for co-creation where the four essential freedoms of software are guaranteed.                As open source adoption has expanded, we have seen changes in the assumptions surrounding licensing, governance and development of open source projects. We will document that evolution and look ahead to see what trends and pressures face the global free and open source software movement as it expands beyond ICT to wireless, distributed devices and beyond.</p>",

NLnet Foundation and Gaer Europe that wrote the strategic vision for the Next Generation Internet initiative will present the work they did in a unique collaboration which sought the expertise of key organisations and communities in the field - like RIPE (the European regional internet registry), GÉANT (research networks), the European assocation of country domain name organisations, ISP associations, the internet exchanges, the open source community (FSFE), the digital civil rights community (EDRi) and Internet Society.

                "description": "<p>2018 celebrates the fifth anniversary of the Edward Snowden revelations. Full details about covert mass scale surveillance at internet scale stripped the internet naked of every romantic assumption we held about it. The news sent a transformative shock throughout the global technology community. We were all convinced the internet would soon fix these horrible security shortcomings now that we knew - although naivity was destroyed and the internet would never be the same again.</p>,                <p>The world has fast forwarded itself five years. We must conclude - with some sadness - that the internet was not fixed for us. We are still waiting for major structural change. To the regular end user, a safe and secure 'post-Snowden' internet is far away: in day to day usage they still by and large have to use the same unfixed and insecure internet we had before.</p>                <p>In fact, things in some areas have gotten worse as other actors besides foreign state agencies have gained immense powers over us. We are now asked by social networks to turn all our nude pictures over to them voluntarily so they may protect us.</p>                <p>One reason for this sad state of affairs, is that it has take time to follow up the Snowden revelations by adequate political measures. And to be frank, it took a while for public funding organisations in Europe to even understand their crucial role in this. The internet is not going to fix itself. Many of the more promising efforts in this realm have been 'bottom up' efforts from individuals or small teams, but these isolated efforts miss critical mass to actually scale up and change the mainstream internet.</p>                <p>The new Next Generation Internet initiative could be the first real opportunity to put large scale public funding to work to really fix the internet. With an order of magnitude of hundreds of millions of euro in research, development and engineering effort it can actually potentially change the balance of power. The Europen Commission (where the money for NGI originates) did not try to invent such a strategy by: it invited NLnet Foundation and Gaer Europe to write a strategic vision for the Next Generation Internet and identify what needs to be done to really move the internet forward. NLnet Foundation is an independent public benefit organisation which was set up by pioneers of the European internet in the eighties, and which has been funding key open source initiatives for over two decades. Gaer Europe is an equally independent consulting company that knows what is being decided in board rooms before anyone else.</p>                <p>In a unique collaboration they sought the expertise of key organisations and communities in the field - like RIPE (the European regional internet registry), GÉANT (research networks), the European assocation of country domain name organisations, ISP associations, the internet exchanges, the open source community (FSFE), the digital civil rights community (EDRi) and Internet Society. So not just the separate communities that operate different 'layers' (or rather slices) of the technology but also what we consider 'ethical guardians' of the internet.</p>                <p>The NGI initiative has learned from the enormous failures of the past five years. Gone will be the need to create artificial consortia. Gone will be a lot of the bureaucratic paperwork. There is a clear vision. There is a plan. And there is money to fund the right things. Open source is seen as the key mechanism to make it actually happen, and the first calls for funding from the NGI initiative are out. Now what is needed is the developers to seize the opportunity to scale up and more importantly to connect their initiatives.</p>                <p>Fixing the internet is a 'moonshot plus' effort: the internet is the largest technical structure man has ever made, and the task at hand is to vastly improve its very operating fabric with 3 billion + people using it on a daily basis. This may essential to our daily operations, but it is equally or even more important for upholding our human values and basic human rights in Europe. In addition to new open source technology this will also require a larger political agenda of Europe as an integral part of the approach too - in some cases regulating the most predatory behaviour from bad actors might be necessary to restore health back to the internet.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The Unix operating system has had a profound influence on the development of open source software and associated communities. Many of today's systems trace their code or design to a 1970 unnamed operating system kernel, implemented in 2489 lines of PDP-7 assembly language. This evolved into the Unix operating system, whose direct descendants include today's BSD systems and intellectual heirs form the various GNU/Linux distributions.</p>                <p>How did the architecture of Unix evolve over the past half century? Based on a <a href=\"https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo\">GitHub repository</a> recording the system's history from 1970 until today, a <a href=\"https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-history-man/index.html\">database recording the evolution of provided facilities</a>, and the reconstruction of the <a href=\"https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-v3man\">Third</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-v4man\">Fourth</a> Edition Unix manuals, we will examine the most significant milestones of this development and the lessons we can learn. Many architectural features, such as layering, system calls, devices as files, an interpreter, and process management, were already visible in the 1970 version. Other ideas followed quickly: the tree directory structure, user contributed code, I/O redirection, the shell as a user program, groups, pipes, and scripting. Later versions added domain-specific languages, environment variables, a documented file system hierarchy, software packages, virtual memory support, optimized screen handling, networking, storage pools, dynamic tracing, and a packet capture library. Based on a record of facilities documented over the years we will see areas in which evolution continues at an unchanged pace and areas where it appears stalled. We will also see how one measure of code complexity has followed a self-correcting path. Lessons we can derive from this amazing ride include the durability of early architectural features, the value of establishing conventions over the imposition of rigid mechanisms, the importance of additions made after the system's gestation, and the increasing difficulty of bringing about ground-breaking changes as Unix ages.</p>",

At the end of this talk, I hope you will understand more about this historic computer and be inspired to build your own EDSAC.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Chip Hack was run as part of the Wuthering Bytes Technology Festival 2017. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the British computer society, EDSAC was recreated on the myStorm FPGA boards. The Verilog implementation was written by Hatim Kanchwala, a Google Summer of Code student from India. The key EDSAC peripherals were reimagined and interfaced with the FPGA boards.</p>                <p>Sir Prof Maurice Wilkes designed EDSAC and built it with the University of Cambridge. Instead of trying to make the computer the fastest or smallest, he wanted EDSAC to be useable so that everyone at the University could have access to a computer for their research. EDSAC stands for electronic delay storage automatic calculator and was based on EDVAC, a binary stored-program computer.</p>                <p>Punched tape was used to read in the programs. The tape was written using 5-bit wide code. In the reimagined version of EDSAC punched tape was read by reflecting light off of the paper as it was fed through by a motor. The amount of light reflected corresponded to the colour of the tape therefore a hole, substituted for by a black dot, could be found. An extra line of dots down the middle worked as a clock line.</p>                <p>Once the program was completed successfully the output would be sent to a teleprinter, a typewriter like electro-mechanical machine. To simulate this, a thermal printer that was able to communicate with an Arduino was interfaced with myStorm Verilog EDSAC. The thermal printer was also used to print the punched tape.</p>                <p>When EDSAC was turned on, a series of instructions had to be read into the machine. This was error prone and took a very long time to do. To fix this problem, rows of switches were added to the front panel of the computer. This meant that the initial instructions could be boot-strapped in upon start up. Due to the price of toggle switches, the reimagined front panel used two rows of headers and connectors. The bottom row of headers was always positively charged. Each set of headers were connected to an Arduino pin. Therefore, when a header pair was connected the pin is pulled high.</p>                <p>The last peripheral reimagined were the delay lines. These were used as part of EDSAC logic to hold multiple words of information. A short word was 18 bits long and the long word was 36 bits long. Due to problems with the logic system, the last bit for each word was lost and so a short word is usually seen to be 17 bits long and the long word is 35 bits long. To store the word, pipes full of mercury had series of pulses send from the top to the bottom of the tubes. A logic circuit would be able to convert the signal received upon every clock pulse to binary and send it back to the top of the tube to be sent down again.</p>                <p>To simulate the mercury delay lines, a material that was safer and cheaper was used to fill the tubes, air. Similar to the original design, a series of pulses held by a 4 kHz carrier was sent down the tube. An Arduino was able to reassemble to series of pulses at the bottom of the tube and resend the information down the tube. Due to travel issues the tubes had to be short so only a few bits could be held in the tube at any one time.</p>                <p>All materials used were open source because the teaching resource created was designed to be easily used in classrooms and maker spaces. All reimagined peripherals use OpenSCAD and a RepRap 3D printer for the 3D printed components.</p>                <p>Overall, Chip Hack was a great success. Everyone who came learned something about Verilog and enjoyed the talks about the history behind EDSAC. It is quite difficult to get the pacing correct when designing a course for beginner and expert so a lot of people needed to spend extra time on the tutorials.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Elektra aims at keeping the diversity and modularity of the FLOSS                ecosystem but also unifies configuration access by abstracting access                to any configuration source using key/value pairs. Participating                applications do not use any hard-coded configuration. Developers,                maintainers, and system administrator can declaratively specify                location and syntax of configuration files, how to validate configuration,                and how to derive default values.</p>                <p>Elektra follows the trend to a more declarative no-futz system                (a system where no experimental tinkering or fiddling is needed).                Getting and setting a configuration value is trivial, and possible in any                programming language. Elektra currently supports C++, Python, Haskell,                Lua, Shell, Ruby, Puppet, and Java. It fulfils necessities long overdue,                not only for configuration management, but also for better defaults. We                provide many essential utilities for system administrators and developers,                such validation before serializing and command-line tools with support for                tab completion of configuration. But no worries: Elektra still leaves                developers the fun parts, like inventing new configuration file formats.</p>",

Ouroboros simplifies creating networked applications by providing a single abstraction that unifies IPC and networking APIs. Ouroboros provides a powerful networking subsystem that allows building secure overlay networks on top of UDP/IP and Ethernet. To increase scale and scope, overlays can be added on top of previously created overlays. Management of applications running on top of Ouroboros, such as making a server application available on a certain overlay, can be done on-the-fly and with great ease.</p>",

The key objective of Ouroboros is, above all, simplicity.</p>                <p>From an administrator's perspective, the three step process to connect processes (register / bind / allocate or bind / register / allocate) greatly simplifies the way one manages server applications.</p>                <p>From a programmer's perspective, the library provides a very simple API (allocate/accept/deallocate, read/write) on top of a naming system that abstracts away the details how IPC is achieved, making writing distributed applications effortless. Asynchronous I/O is done by a scalable event system modeled on BSD's kqueue. The system is configured using a single call based on the well-known ioctl/fcntl calls and configurations for integrating TLS-like security are being implemented.</p>                <p>As it is a lot more than just a library, the Ouroboros network subsystem integrates a fully distributed packet-switched network that can be bootstrapped on top of a UDP network or on top of Ethernet if a suitable interface is found on the system (raw sockets on Linux, BPF on FreeBSD and OSX, or netmap if installed).</p>                <p>Finally, we will end with some future directions in research and steps that are needed to bring the Ouroboros implementation beyond its current prototype state.</p>                <p>Ouroboros is under active development at Ghent University - imec and written in C for POSIX-compliant operating systems.

History is sprinkled with software horror tales: race condition in radiation therapy machine Therac-25 caused deaths and injuries, badly written automotive software caused unintended acceleration, bugs in the entertainment system allowed an attacker to take remote (full) control of a car,  software glitches caused (many times) chaos in the stock market and so on...  Unfortunately many think that bugs are like bad weather: annoying, but unavoidable, so that the only solution is to have patience and bear with them.</p>                <p>However, I agree with late Robert Dewar when he says that <a href=\"https://www.businesscomputingworld.co.uk/software-glitches-why-we-shouldnt-put-up-with-them/\">we should not put up with them</a>. With the future advent of IoT, putting up with glitches it is an open invitation for the Software Apocalypse.  Therefore, I decided to start <strong>Terra Bruciata</strong>, an open source initiative whose goal of is to bring a software correctness mentality in the open source community. We will try to adapt to an open source context procedures and good practices from standards like DO-178 and using techniques such as formal checking. We will initially concentrate on libraries for network protocols.  Although this choice can seem strange, it has its rationale. First, network protocols are pervasive nowadays and a bug in a network library can easily become a security hole.  Moreover, the IETF has the desire to improve the involvement of open source communities and academia in protocol developments and this initiative could be an interesting channel for that. The initiative just started and as first protocol we choose <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252\">CoAP</a>, the <em>Constrained Application Protocol</em>, a kind of <em>lo-weight</em> HTTP, developed having in mind small devices IoT-style (yes, it is fashionable...)</p>",

This is useful to move between clusters, possibly using different technologies, but also as a fail-over for publishers in case of downtime on a cluster. Timelines can also be used to move event types between brokers on the same cluster, which is an alternative to rebalance operations. Contrary to rebalance operations, using timelines does not require additional data copy between brokers, which can slow them down. Future plans include using timelines for re-partitioning, i.e. changing the number of partitions in an event type.</p>                <p>Nakadi is used at Zalando, to produce around 15 terabytes and consume around 40 terabytes of data daily.</p>",

The evidence is already out there—a connected car can produce up to 5 terabytes of data hourly, an oil and gas drilling rig can produce 7 to 8 terabytes of data daily. Waiting for all of this data to be sent to the cloud and acted upon won’t cut it for many applications in industrial or consumer domains. Even for edge analytical applications, conventional big data architectures that involve forwarding everything to the cloud to be stored and analysed doesn’t make sense—what you likely need are Machine Learning and streaming analytics capabilities at the edge.</p>",

                "description": "<hr />                <p>The internet has lost its way. What was promised to be an open cyberspace where digital communities could form and flourish has turned into a landscape of unmovable monoliths. It may not have wanted this, but flaws in the design of its infrastructure and software set it up to fail.</p>                <p>Security is hard, but the defaults aren't helping. Without diving into often complicated configurations and the inner machinations of your system, the best you're going to get is an unencrypted connection and passwords stored in plain text. Sysadmins can do this. Your parents probably can't.</p>                <p>Social networks don't put you in touch with your friends. They put you in touch with a server that helps you talk to your friends. It's difficult to form cohesive communities when you see everyone through a filtered stream of data, rather than getting to exchange content directly.</p>                <p>Wheels are being re-invented over and over again. WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, Telegram... can you still tell them apart? They fulfill nearly the exact same purpose, using practically identical interfaces. Why can't I message my friends on Twitter using Signal?</p>                <p>Everyone has a ton of accounts for all kinds of redundant services. You're just one person, and yet you're forced to juggle many different online identities. Password fatigue is at an all-time high precisely when people need to start caring more. Software isn't helping them care.</p>                <p>Trolls and spammers have no problem with creating many different identities though. They do their thing, and if they get banned, they just spin up a new account to continue their shady practices on.</p>                <p>What if the internet had been built with good, secure defaults?                What if machines on that network could talk directly to each other, without requiring a sysadmin skillset?                What if there was a general-purpose software stack for communication between individuals?                What if everyone had their own, personal address on the network?                What if the barrier to entry was just high enough to keep spammers out?                What if we had Urbit?</p>                <p>Urbit is a re-imagining of the internet. It paves over all our existing infrastructure and builds its own brand-new stack on top of it, solving the problems it has seen arise at the root. In doing so, it aims to deliver generic infrastructure for a decentralized network of personal servers to grow on.</p>                <p>The Urbit virtual machine runs a sort of assembly language called Nock. Nock is so simple, its official specification fits on a t-shirt.</p>                <p>But just like nobody is expected to write raw assembly, nobody is expected to write raw Nock. Urbit has invented Hoon, a vaguely Lisp-like functional programming language. Though its syntax may seem alien at first, this up-front complexity is the price it pays for semantic simplicity. When it comes down to it, Hoon is quite a dumb language. It has recently been deemed mature enough to be handed off to the community for further development and maintenance.</p>                <p>The Urbit operating system, Arvo, is implemented entirely in Hoon. It uses a handful of kernel modules to give rise to a functional, decentralized network of personal servers. At all times, the state of these servers is the sum of all events they have ever received.</p>                <p>Arguably the most important of the kernel modules is Ames, the networking module. Packets it sends are encrypted by default, only readable by the intended recipients. The network it creates is hierarchically ordered, with higher-order nodes being responsible for peer discovery and software updates for their children. In the event a parent's child misbehaves, it can get kicked out. In the event a child is unsatisfied with the service its parent provides, it can find another node willing to adopt it. This way, digital cities can form. Not around centralized servers, but around communities on the network.</p>                <p>All of this already exists. Urbit is very much a functional piece of software. Though still operating on a testnet, it has managed to gather a vibrant community of users and developers alike who are fed up with the ever increasing centralization of the internet.</p>                <p>It's not yet ready to replace the internet, however. Things will start off a bit smaller than that. Urbit is starting to prove itself very useful for API aggregation: managing and mirroring all your existing online identities in one single place. Eventually, this can seamlessly transition into using Urbit's generic, decentralized messaging bus instead of the traditional services themselves.                Personal publishing is another application you can use your Urbit for. People are already hosting blogs on their Urbits, and incoming changes are going to make this even better.</p>                <p>The internet has lost its way, so let's build it right this time.</p>",

Currently it supports msp430, x86, xtensa, avr, arm, open risc and stm8 computer architectures, in various levels of maturity. The supported languages are C3 and brainfuck. Language support for C is a work in progress.</p>                <p>The C3 language was the starting point for the compiler, aiming at being a better version of C. It has no header files, but features a more modular approach like C# and java. Furthermore its syntax is context free, making it easier to parse using standard compiler tools.</p>                <p>The backend of the compiler consists of a code generator featuring both instruction selection and register coloring algorithms.

However, productivity would be very much increased if the writing-correction-publication would be taken a step (or two forward) to a continuous integration/continuous delivery DevOps-like environment where you define by software the whole pipeline a book is going to follow from writing to publication. LitOps is a transpiling of the DevOps culture to book production, using mainly software development tools, and rigging them so that you can produce and publish quality-checked books using as many automation tools as possible.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Although most arts make extensive use of automation tools, from textures in comic to automatic motion generation tools in 2 or 3-d animation, writing a book, whatever its class, technical or fiction, gives the word manuscript its full meaning, since the most advanced tool used is the spell and maybe grammar checker. This leads to long development cycles, with new editions published after long rewriting-edition-production cycles.                Nowadays, authors can publish directly using a variety of places, from Leanpub to Kindle Direct Publishing, and there are all kind of tools available for doing that kind of thing. Still, this has not lead to fast production cycles where new editions are produced as soon as \"bugs\" are found and fixed and all formats are published at the same time.                My personal history in this area started when I decided to write a book from the first line using GitHub. That lead to using continuous integration, and it kind of ballooned from here. Nowadays I have created a full automation suite, in Perl6 and Python, that produces \"printed\" versions (shortening and expanding URLs), checks for line bleeds, and produces several high-quality formats from a Markdown source; time from change to new publication-ready version takes a few seconds. The only thing missing is an API for publication sites that would allow to make an automatic deployment. However, even without that final steps, the LitOps concept that codifies book production pipelines using scripts, including error checks and the rest, actually might mean a sea change in how fiction and non-fiction is produced, using LitOps teams and adopting the rest of the patterns of the software industry: forking, hackathons and linting, and finally taking manuscripting to this century.</p>",

                "description": "<p>A virtual network function (or VNF), as commonly known today, is a software implementation of a network function that runs on one or more virtual machines (VMs) on top of the hardware networking infrastructure — routers, switches, etc. Individual virtual network functions can be connected or combined together as building blocks to offer a full-scale networking communication service. A VNF may be implemented as standalone entity using existing networking and orchestration paradigms - for example being managed through CLI, SNMP or Netconf. Alternatively, an NFV may be a part of an SDN architecture, where the control plane resides in an SDN controller and the data plane is implemented in the VNF.</p>                <p>A cloud-native VNF is a VNF designed for the emerging cloud environment - it runs in a container rather than a VM, its lifecycle is orchestrated by a container orchestration system, such as Kubernetes, and it's using cloud-native orchestration paradigms. In other words, its control/management plane looks just like any other container based 12-factor app. to orchestrator or external clients it exposes REST or gRPC APIs, data stored in centralized KV data stores, communicate over message bus, cloud-friendly logging and config, cloud friendly build &amp; deployment process, etc., Depending on the desired functionality, scale and performance, a cloud- native VNF may provide a high-performance data plane, such as the VPP.</p>                <p>Ligato (https://github.com/ligato) is a Golang platform for building cloud-native microservices. Although it was originally intended for development/implementation of custom management/control plane agents for cloud-native Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), it can be used to develop any microservice. Each management/control plane app built on top of the CN-Infra platform is basically a set of modules called \"plugins\", where each plugin provides a very specific/focused functionality. Some plugins are provided by the platform itself, some are written by the app's implementors. In other words, the Ligato platform itself is implemented as a set of plugins that together provide the platform's functionality, such as logging, health checks, messaging (e.g. Kafka), a common front-end API and back-end connectivity to various KV data stores (Etcd, Cassandra, Redis, ...), and REST and gRPC APIs.</p>              <p>The platform is modular and extensible. Plugins supporting new functionality (e.g. another KV store or another message bus) can be easily added to the existing set of Ligato platform plugins. Moreover, Ligato based apps can be built in layers: a set of app plugins together with platform plugins can form a new platform providing APIs/services to higher layer apps. This approach was used to create a management/control plane agent for VPP (https://FD.io). The VPP Agent is basically a set of VPP-specific plugins that use the core Ligato platform to interact with other services / microservices in the cloud (e.g. a KV data store, messaging, log warehouse, etc.). The VPP Agent exposes VPP functionality to client apps via a VPP-specific model-driven API. Clients that consume this API may be either external (connecting to the VPP Agent via REST, gRPC API, Etcd or message bus transport), or local Apps and/or Extension plugins running on the same CN-Infra platform in the same Linux process.</p>",

With the increase of Ethernet speeds from 40, 100 to                200 Gbits/s, the need for high-speed raw Ethernet frame delivery to                Linux user-space is ever increasing. In this talk, we present AF<em>XDP                (formerly known as AF</em>PACKET V4) designed to scale to these high                networking speeds through the use of true zero-copy, lock-less data                structures, elimination of syscalls and other techniques, while still                abiding to the isolation and security rules of Linux. AF_XDP is                currently an RFC on the Linux netdev mailing list with the goal to                get it accepted upstream.</p>                <p>In our evaluation, AF<em>XDP provides a performance increase of up to 40x                for some microbenchmarks and 20x for tcpdump compared to previous                AF</em>PACKET (raw socket) versions in Linux. To illustrate the approach,                we have implemented support for Intel I40E NICs and veth, but it should                hopefully be easy to port to other NICs and virtual devices as                well. AF<em>XDP is designed as an extension to the existing XDP support                in Linux so that XDP enabled devices will be able to use this. We also                show how SW networking libraries and SDKs such as DPDK can benefit                from AF</em>XDP to achieve increased robustness, ease-of-use and HW                independence.</p>",

The IPv6 instantiation, allows to deliver a so called network program, where a packet traverses the network executing functions on different nodes of the network. This functions can be NPU-related functions, or it can be complex VNFs running in containers. In this way, we can leverage SRv6 for overlays, underlays and service chaining all from one single protocol.                In this session we want to give a brief overview on SRv6, cover the SRv6 implementation in FD.io VPP, as well as showcase how to create your own network functions in VPP. Also, we would like to showcase how to develop SRv6 functions in Linux, and show the first-ever SRv6-aware app in the world: SERA, an advanced SR aware firewall, capable of taking stateless actions programmed in the SRH (Segment Routing Header).</p>                <p>Speaker: This workshop will be lead by two speakers.</p>                <p>Speaker 1:              Pablo Camarillo is a software engineer in Cisco CTAO. He's one of the members of the core SRv6 architecture team and has developed the SR implementation in FD.io VPP. Prior joining Cisco, he was a research engineer at IMDEA Networks institute, where he prototyped a BGP route server in ExaBGP and researched on the algorithmic of TI-LFA (SR Topology Independent Loop Free Alternates).</p>                <p>Speaker 2:              Ahmed Abdelsalam is a PhD student at Gran Sasso Science Institute researching on SRv6 for SFC in Linux.

One way to address that is by allowing queries to be processed by more than one core at a time; which the project started to enable with 9.6, extended a lot in version 10, with significant additional features expected in 11.  But that does not address the efficiency / economics of overall query execution.</p>                <p>This talk will focus on increasing the efficiency of query execution by just in time compiling parts of queries. That is, instead of having roughly interpreter like code to execute the queries, emit native code doing precisely the work needed for a specific query.</p>                <p>The current goal of the project is to use LLVM to perform JIT of two main parts of query execution:</p>                <ul>                <li>expression evaluation (WHERE clause, aggregates, GROUP BY clauses, etc)</li>                <li>tuple deforming (converting on-disk tuples into a more efficiently accessible in-memory representation)</li>                </ul>                <p>and to integrate as much of that work as possible into PostgreSQL 11.</p>                <p>We'll discuss:</p>                <ul>                <li>how the above parts of the system were identified as the primary bottlenecks</li>                <li>how JIT compilation can help resolve them</li>                <li>which structural changes to postgres were required to allow for JIT compilation</li>                <li>how JIT compilation is currently implemented, including the current development state</li>                <li>the problems faced using LLVM for this task, and which improvements to it could make it better for the use-case</li>                </ul>                <p>Depending on the available time, we'll also discuss possible future avenues for optimization.</p>",

The library is based on the <a href=\"https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web\">TypeScript gRPC-Web library by Improbable</a>. It allows the user to define the frontend-backend interface as a proto3 protobuf file and generate a Go-gRPC-client-like interface for the GopherJS frontend to consume. In addition, it allows the user to write GopherJS frontends for generic gRPC servers, with the use of a proxy developed by Improbable. For more information about gRPC-Web see <a href=\"https://improbable.io/games/blog/grpc-web-moving-past-restjson-towards-type-safe-web-apis\">Improbable's blog post</a>.</p>                <p>My library further extends the capabilities of the Improbable library by adding client side and bidirectional streaming over a websockets with a custom Go proxy library.</p>                <p>I have developed a demo for the library, available on <a href=\"https://grpcweb.jbrandhorst.com\">https://grpcweb.jbrandhorst.com</a>.</p>                <p>The presentation will start with a quick introduction to Protobuf, gRPC and gRPC-Web, then introduce GopherJS and my GopherJS gRPC-Web bindings and walk through development of a small web app using GopherJS, the GopherJS gRPC-Web bindings and a generic Go gRPC backend server. I have previously delivered a lightning talk to the London Go User Group on the topic of this library, <a href=\"https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/10924-using-grpc-web-to-connect-gopherjs-apps-to-grpc-backends\">recording available</a>.

Each release of the Go runtime comes with a slightly faster collector, but you can make                much bigger performance improvements by not creating garbage in the first place:              if you can rework your code to make fewer heap allocations, then the garbage collector                will run less often and have less work to do.</p>                <p>Examples will be drawn from real-world experience optimising the Open Source container visualisation project <a href=\"https://github.com/weaveworks/cortex\">Weave Cortex</a>.</p>",

Because we wrote this in Go, we could also interact with other Go SDKs for products and services we look after, like AWS and Hashicorp Vault, to prepare an environment for these containers.</p>                <p>This worked really well! Too well, in fact, as people from across the company started asking us \"can you add XYZ to this tool?\".                We didn't want our tool to become bloated, so we open-sourced the guts of our tool for other teams to create their own versions, with the tools they needed.</p>",

For this reason, we have recently included Go as one of several candidate programming languages in an evaluation of their suitability for expressing sequencing pipelines. Other programming languages we have evaluated were C++ and Java. Go hits a sweet spot of performing very close to the best results with little programming effort and few compromises in terms of safety and generality.</p>                <p>This talk will present highlights of this experiments and the most important insights.</p>",
                "description": "<p>A DNA sequencer takes a DNA sample, such as human tissue, and applies chemical processes to eventually read small fragments of the DNA sample and output them as large files. These files are then fed into software pipelines that reconstruct the original DNA sequence from those fragments, among other things. Such sequencing pipelines need large amounts of storage, on disk and/or in RAM, and can strongly benefit from parallel execution to improve runtime performance. Data sets for human DNA samples are usually in the order of several hundreds of GB of uncompressed data, and runtimes are typically in the order of several hours for single samples.</p>                <p>Go is usually presented as a language designed for concurrent applications, and it is usually stressed that support for parallel programming  was not a major design goal. It may therefore be surprising to a larger audience that Go actually fares very well for parallel programming tasks, with relatively little effort. This talk may encourage Go developers to explore the language for application areas that can benefit from parallelism, beyond the domains where Go is typically used.</p>                <p><strong>Please note that this talk replaces one entitled \"Writing a structured syslog parser in Go\" that was due to have been given by Brian Knox, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend FOSDEM this year.</strong></p>",

Examples include:</p>                <ul>                <li>minimal experience with the VCS used by the project (Git, Mercurial, ...);</li>                <li>some familiarity with the platform where the project repository is located (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, ...);</li>                <li>being aware of the project-specific contribution policy (for example feature &amp; target branches, how to ;</li>                </ul>                <p>Although these hurdles can be overcome with a reasonable amount of effort,                for example by reading the project's documentation or following some basic tutorials,                they turn out to be a showstopper for some people.                Possible reasons include:</p>                <ul>                <li>limited interest in getting familiar with all required details, especially for first-time or infrequent contributors;</li>                <li>a lack of time to learn how to overcome these hurdles;</li>                <li>becoming demotivated quickly because of problems encountered while following the contribution process;</li>                </ul>                <p>This can result in a significant amount of (potentially very useful) lost contributions...</p>                <p>In addition, project maintainers often lack the time required to process all incoming contributions.                Doing so not only requires a visual review of the code changes, but also testing, enforcing code style requirements, providing feedback, etc.</p>                <p>In this talk, I will outline the extensive GitHub integration that has been implemented in EasyBuild,                a framework implemented in Python for building and installing (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems.</p>                <p>The EasyBuild command line interface has been extended to add support for:</p>                <ul>                <li>previewing pull requests by comparing with current state of the project repository;</li>                <li>fully automatically creation of new pull requests (covering both the Git workflow &amp; GitHub interface);</li>                <li>updating existing pull requests to resolve problems or implement suggestions made by maintainers;</li>                <li>testing contributions by pulling in the changes from GitHub for local testing;</li>                <li>uploading test reports back into pull requests to efficiently communicate whether the contribution works on other systems;</li>                <li>reviewing pull requests by cross-referencing with existing relevant files (if any);</li>                <li>merging pull requests after checking that all requirements are met (approval by Travis CI, successful test report, visual review by a maintainer, correct target branch, milestone set, ...)</li>                </ul>                <p>In addition a bot was implemented to automatically notify contributors &amp; maintainers that the Travis CI build for a pull request is failing (which is not supported by Travis CI itself).</p>                <p>These features have been implemented by leveraging the GitPython library, the GitHub REST API, and the Travis CI API.</p>                <p>They have proven invaluable for both contributors (regardless of experience) and EasyBuild maintainers, by streamlining the contribution process.                In addition, this has resulted in:</p>                <ul>                <li>significantly reduced effort to contribute (even for experienced contributors);</li>                <li>an increase in contributors &amp; contributions;</li>                <li>better consistency in contributions;</li>                <li>less time spent by maintainers to process contributions.</li>                </ul>                <p>I hope this talk can motivate other projects (large &amp; small) to implement similar features to simplify their contribution process, since this is a critical part of building a community around a software project.                The EasyBuil features that are outlined can also be implemented in other projects, regardless of the programming language being used and the scope of the project.</p>",

                "description": "<p>With over 40% of folks automatically deploying the results of their Spark jobs to production, testing is especially important. Many of the tools for working with big data systems (like notebooks) are great for exploratory work, and can give a false sense of security (as well as additional excuses not to test). This talk explores why testing these systems are hard, special considerations for simulating \"bad\" partioning, figuring out when your stream tests are stopped, and solutions to these challenges.</p>",

Query languages like openCypher, implemented in systems like Neo4j, SAP HANA Graph and Redis Graph, allow the intuitive definition of graph patterns including structural and semantic predicates.</p>                <p>For now, graph query languages are most prominent in graph database systems such as Neo4j. However, we think that many systems can benefit from having such a language in their toolbox. One of these systems is Apache Spark, which is one of the most popular open source frameworks in the context of distributed processing of large data volumes within complex analytical workloads.                To bring the benefits of Cypher from the graph database realm into the world of Big Data, we at Neo4j started developing Cypher for Apache Spark (CAPS). CAPS is primarily focused on graph-powered data integration and graph analytical query workloads within the Spark ecosystem. In addition, CAPS is our testbed for Cypher language extensions as specified in the openCypher project; for example, multiple graphs, graph transformations and construction, and query composition.</p>                <p>In our talk, we want to motivate use-cases for CAPS and give an overview of new querying capabilities which we demonstrate using Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin. Furthermore, we briefly present the internal architecture highlighting the main differences between Neo4j and CAPS.</p>",

It is a closed graph query language that includes graph pattern matching, inclusive extended regular path expressions, graph construction (graph projection and graph aggregation), and (weighted) shortest path finding. The query language queries graphs and returns a graph. Hence, it supports views and correlated sub-queries, which have proven their worth in the relational databases. To ensure that the query language is practically usable on large data, G-CORE builds on previous complexity results and carefully select useful features, but restricted in such ways that the resulting language is polynomial in data complexity. As such, G-CORE connects the practical work done in industrial proposals with the foundational research on graph databases; in fact, it can be considered as a bridge between these two worlds.</p>",

                "abstract": "<p>JavaScript is one of the decade’s most trending languages. It ranked <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies\">#1 in popularity in Stack Overflow questions</a> and is consistently featured in the <a href=\"https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/\">top 10 languages of the TIOBE Index</a>. Originally intended for client-side scripting, the language is now widely used to build complex desktop applications, write server-side code and program IoT devices. The latest standards of the language are released yearly under the <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm\">ECMAScript trademark</a> and contain sophisticated features and syntactical constructs.</p>                <p><em>Static analysis</em> is a software testing approach that is performed without compiling and executing the program itself. This allows developers to catch programming errors before building, testing and deploying the code. There is a wide range of static analysis tools: linters and code style analysers repeatedly perform checks in IDEs, while more complex analyzers, such as type checkers, run as part of the continuous integration (CI) process.</p>                <p>As JavaScript is a <em>dynamic language</em>, static analysis approaches are particularly useful: they can detect erroneous type usages that would not be revealed by building the code, but only occur during thorough testing or even worse, at production. Thanks to the popularity of the language, there are already numerous approaches for static analysis available, such as <a href=\"http://ternjs.net/\">Tern</a>, Facebook’s <a href=\"https://flow.org/\">Flow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.brics.dk/TAJS/\">TAJS</a>. However, none of these fitted all of our requirements:</p>                <ul>                <li>Utilise both linter-style and complex global analysis rules.</li>                <li>Evaluate rules in real-time, i.e. in sub-seconds upon each “save” operation.</li>                <li>Allow users to easily extend the analysis rules.</li>                </ul>                <p>As none of the current approaches satisfied these requirements, we built our own solution that uses a <em>property graph query engine</em> to represent the <em>code graphs</em> used for analysis and <em>graph queries</em> to evaluate the analysis rules. Compared to other static analysis frameworks, the novelty of our solution is twofold:</p>                <ul>                <li>We <em>continuously maintain code graphs</em> based on the latest changes on the source code.</li>                <li>We use the <em>declarative openCypher language</em> to define the static analysis and graph maintenance rules.</li>                </ul>                <p>Using declarative queries, our tool is able to perform the complex analysis queries quickly, including:</p>                <ul>                <li>Detecting asynchronous method calls with missing await statements (a common issue in the <a href=\"http://callbackhell.com/\">callback hell</a>).</li>                <li>Detecting unreachable code, i.e. code parts that cannot be reached through the control flow.</li>                </ul>                <p>The analysis can be easily extended by custom analysis rules defined in the openCypher language. Building the system on openCypher also allows us to use different query engines: both mature databases, such as Neo4j, and also experimental engines, such as our own <a href=\"http://docs.inf.mit.bme.hu/ingraph/\">ingraph engine</a>. The latter is our research prototype that supports live query evaluation for Cypher queries, which allows near instant answers even for complex analysis rules.</p>                <p>In this talk, we give an overview of the steps involved in transforming the source code file to a syntax graph and converting it to a call flow graph. We demonstrate how openCypher queries can be used to capture complex analysis rules in a concise way, and how ingraph allows us to continuously evaluate these queries.</p>",

The current situation for LibreOffice documentation is that producing contents is still a lenghty and hard task, often requiring rework depending on different sort of publiccation needed. In this presentation, we will summarize the efforts done so far within the LibreOffice ecosystem and make the point on the need for a different approach to make the LibreOffice documentation an element of communty gathering and contribution, extending the range of the quality of the software.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Complex softwares for end-users like office suites or desktop environment, to name a few, are impacted in their adoption because of the need to educate and train users to the new tools. Undocumented software raise a set of issues that prevents broad adoption by the organizations or governments, and leave brilliant ideas and features into obscrurity. The Document Foundation and it's flagship software LibreOffice, as well as other FOSS communities needs to address the issue of making the end-user documetnation broadly available and updated.</p>                <p>On the other hand, end users being part of the software community, are often eager to collaborate and contribute to the software documentation, but hit a quite steep entry barrier because of the development skills need in editing software help files or on advanced word processing skills for editing a guide with the software. Also, Q&amp;A-shaped web services, wikis and dynamic multimedia documentation also bring challenges to documentation because of the need for accuracy and update.</p>                <p>The purpose of the presentation is to deliver a vision on the optimal documentation production for complex end-user softwares, that will address several documentation issues existing in the FOSS business and community envoronment. We call this Project Convergence. Here is waht we foresee:</p>                <ul>                <li>Address the reduction of documentation rework, issues by the multiple publishing medias, such as online reading, printed guides or multimedia documents</li>                <li>Have its contents editable by a large set of contributors, under proper security, and with the easiest way to add contents, so new contributors can quickly add contents instead of learning obscure features of the file markup.</li>                <li>Be computer-aided-translation (CAT) friendly, to reach the broader public around the world in whatever language.</li>                <li>Synchronized with the latest developments of the software, thus reducing the gap between development and documentation.</li>                </ul>                <p>We will also present our latest development in the documentation tools of LibreOffice, in the effort to evolve technologically and benefit of the develpment of the web and invite for discussion all documentation leaders of similar software projects.</p>",

One of the complaints that power users make in Online is that it lacks many of them: they cannot add colored borders in their paragraphs, manage tracked changes/comments, correct the spelling and grammar in the document, etc. The question is how do we bring these functionalities to the cloud at your disposal in your browser tab?</p>                <p>We at Collabora decided to come up with a plan to just tunnel all the hard work that developers have done for the past couple of decades: come up with appropriate infrastructure to open the dialog in headless mode, paint it as a bitmap in the backend, and tunnel the image to you in the browser. And then add life to them by tunnelling your mouse/key events back which will invalidate and update the new image you see in the browser. Of course we are not sending the whole dialog image back to your browser every time - only the part that needs updating in the dialog is sent back to the browser saving us precious time and network bandwidth improving your UX.</p>",

An example of such a system                and the focus of this work is the new Cavium ThunderX2 supercomputer at the                GW4 Isambard project. This paper intends to detail the methodology used to                extend the capabilities of the Valgrind tool: Cachegrind. This extension will                enable it to model both the L2 and L3 caches separately, as opposed to as a                single last level cache. This support will be added for both the ARMv8                architecture, in order to model performance on the Isambard supercomputer, and                in addition x86_64, for comparative purposes. As a result of this extension,                the Isambard project will be able to optimise frequently used programs, in                order to reduce CPU time used and therefore improve throughput on the system.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Valgrind's Memcheck tool reports various kinds of errors.  One of the most                important ones are those where an if-conditions or a memory address uses                undefined data.  To do this, it tracks the definedness of every bit in the                process, and \"follows\" any undefinedness through arithmetic operations (Add,                Sub, Mul, Or, Xor, etc).</p>                <p>This tracking is expensive and so Memcheck makes compromises, trading off                exactness for speed.  That has worked well for many years.  However, as                compilers become more aggressive, this works less and less well.  In                particular, Memcheck now often reports false errors in optimised code from                GCC 6, Clang 4, and later versions.  This is a problem because one of                Memcheck's main strengths is the accuracy of its analyses.</p>                <p>In this talk I'll present my ongoing work to improve accuracy of definedness                tracking.  I'll mostly talk about various examples involving integer                addition and comparisons, and will avoid gory details of Memcheck's                internals.  I'll also show two problems to which I have no solution.</p>                <p>The talk should be accessible to anyone with some familiarity of basic                integer arithmetic (add, sub, and/or/xor, etc) and is curious about how                undefinedness \"flows\" through these operations.  If you like maths and                proving simple theorems, you might enjoy this talk too -- and we'd like                to talk to you!</p>",

Ftrace's ability to show the events that lead up to severe problem gives                a better chance of finding exactly what caused it and can help the developer  a lot. API to talk with Ftrace is located in a Debugfs file system. typically mounted at /sys/kernel/debug.                You can also use 'trace-cmd' utility for easier access.</p>                <p>After a brief history and introduction about tracing tools (SystemTap, eBPF, LTT-ng, ...) we will (briefly) talk about Ftrace internals and describe main features :</p>                <ul>                <li>installing it on embedded distribution such as Buildroot or Yocto (ARM platform)</li>                <li>tracing kernel functions (function, function_graph)</li>                <li>kernel messages (trace_printk)</li>                <li>markers (trace_marker)</li>                <li>events</li>                </ul>                <p>After describing a simple use-case for a kernel driver we will focus on  events and use trace-cmd on \"realtime\" application running on standard Linux then PREEMPT_RT (ARM).</p>                <p>We will compare performances of a POSIX based periodic task using SCHED<em>FIFO or SCHED</em>OTHER on both kernel and finally generate graphs with GNU-plot.</p>",

                "abstract": "<p>DTrace for Linux</p>                <p>DTrace is a dynamic tracing tool that allows kernel and userspace tracing in                operating systems. It was first implemented for Sun's Solaris and later adopted                by other operating systems (Mac OS X, BSD). The Linux port is still ongoing.</p>                <p>In this talk, I would like to introduce the D language and its features. After a                brief introduction the talk will focus on the architecture of the DTrace itself.                Last part of the talk will be focused on the current status of the project.</p>                <p>DTrace is able to process data directly in kernel like eBPF. This allows us to                perform some actions at the time an event has occured rather than during post                processing of the records later in userspace. It allows also more precise selection                of events of interest.</p>                <p>It is possible to use DTrace in many use cases:</p>                <pre><code>- A kernel hacker may precisely monitor the Linux kernel                - A system administrator might use DTrace as an underlying technology                for observing system behavior.                - Participation in distributed tracing of complex scenarios                </code></pre>                <p>I would like to show some real life examples how DTrace can be used to inspect                running system or as source for external telemetric system.</p>",
                "description": "<p>There are many tracers in the Linux world today with different aproaches to achive                their goals. One way to group them depends on when the data processing happens.</p>                <p>DTrace is a predecessor of eBPF. The difference is that eBPF alone is not easy to                handle from user perspective. For that purpose a BCC project has started that provides                compiler and runtime libraries based on llvm to allow end users write tracing tools                in high level languages (C/Python). DTrace is based on D language (DTrace own language)                and has its own compiler built-in. This does not require any high-level language skills                or extra tools to start using DTrace.</p>",

To reduce space a lot of different strategies are being used. Separate .debug files, .gnu_debuglink, build-ids, compressed ELF sections, debug types in ELF COMDAT sections, the Dwarf Compressor DWZ .multi files, DWARF Supplementary Object Files, GNU Debug Fission, split-dwarf .dwo files, DWARF Package Files .dwp files. The basic structure of describing a program with a tree of Debug Information Entries (DIEs) with attributes per compile unit augmented with some auxiliary data structures to map to source files, describe macros used in the source and get call frame information hasn't fundementally changed between DWARF version 2 and version 5. But the hierarchy of the representation and where the bits are stored has become much more complex. It is no longer possible to just see the DWARF descriptions as a fancy symbol table which can be simply indexed through some offsets. It has also become much more expressive than that.</p>",

The overhaul of the language and toolset starting in 2010 increased greatly the language subset, dropping in effect the need for separate grammar rules.  Since then, SPARK has progressively adopted most of the Ada features, to a point where the last remaining non-SPARK significant Ada feature today is pointers.  We have started work on including safe pointers in SPARK, borrowing the ideas of pointer ownership from Rust.  So one can legitimately wonder what difference remains between SPARK and Ada.</p>",

I will give a preview of the support envisioned for pointers in SPARK.  So that the distinction between Ada and SPARK appears clearly: it's not about quantity, it's about safety and security.</p>                <p>In the second part of this talk, I will give a tour of FOSS projects which are using SPARK today: Aida, Certyflie, Muen, PolyORB-HI, Pulsar, StratoX, Tokeneer.  For each one, I will describe at which level of assurance SPARK is used, with how much efforts and for which benefits.  Then I will focus on the largest one, Muen, an x86/64 separation kernel for high assurance.

This is evidenced by the Genode developers who use the system day to day. Being a component-based system designed after the principle of least privilege from the very beginning, it breaks with many concepts that we take for granted in traditional operating systems, e.g., the central role of files. Instead, Genode introduces a novel way of composing system scenarios out of building blocks where the building blocks are able to cooperate without ultimately trusting each other.</p>                <p>The composition of Genode systems used to be defined at system-integration time before booting the system. However, Genode also allows completely dynamic compositions where the system's behavior and structure can be changed at runtime. This ability is the basis for the use of Genode as a general-purpose OS. The talk introduces Sculpt, which is the designated blue-print for interactive and fully dynamic Genode systems.</p>",

All the data that the computer processed always passed through the main memory in one way or the other and the code running on the CPU manipulated with the data, directly on indirectly.

However, trends for a major change in the status quo are finally emerging into the mainstream. These new architectures, often called data-centric computing or near-data processing, propose to turn an ordinary computer into a distributed system where the distinction between the CPU, main memory and peripherals is much more blurry. Components such as individual DRAM chips, flash memory chips and NICs should have autonomous computing capabilities and the possibility to interchange data between other components without the involvement of the main CPU.</p>                <p>This talk will present a brief overview of the concepts and discuss the consequences for operating system designs, especially regarding microkernels.</p>",

In these environments, the application runs directly inside the kernel without the need of a general purpose operating system. In this talk, I will present recent experimentation in which the scheduler of Toro is optimized to reduce the CPU usage of a VM. It has been identified three cases in which the scheduler can be optimized to reduce the impact of idle loops. To validate these techniques, I will present the impact of the improvements on a live running Toro VM on top of QEMU and Hyper-V. Open questions are welcome throughout the session to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this approach but also take-away lessons.</p>",

As common for microkernel-based systems the whole networking infrastructure, down from the drivers up to the socket implementation resides in the userland and comes in cleanly separated building bricks. Today, the framework provides various such building bricks to be combined into an individual solution for each use case. This includes components like an L2/L3-router component with NAT and DHCP functionality, a network-bridge component, a socket-filesystem server using VFS, NIC and Wifi-drivers, as well as libraries like the Lightweight IP and the Linux IP stack. The talk shall give an overview about the design of this ecosystem, how it can be used, how it evolved, and, last but not least, discuss its future.</p>",

The goal was to run several \"pots\" on my laptop to serve my needs and, at the same time, to learn how to manage them efficiently, especially in term disk usage. Instead of using/extending existing tools, like ezjail or iocage, I decided to reinvent the wheel and to write myself a new tool.                After some time, I realized that making pot more generic and available to everyone could be a good idea and that's what I intend to present.                I also show some interesting use cases and, hopefully, a live demo.</p>",

Topics of the class include an introduction to the Unix shell, editors, filesystems (with a big focus on ZFS), shell programming, grep/sed/awk and since 2017, I also added Ansible. In this talk, I want to reflect on what I learned interacting with the students of various (Unix) backgrounds. I also want to discuss with the audience how to improve the class with relevant topics so that the students get the most out of the class and for their later Unix careers. I'll provide an insight into my labs and what we do there with FreeBSD, too.</p>",

                "abstract": "<p>With the evolution of integrated circuits (ICs), 3D integration is becoming a short and middle term viable solution to increase the system performance, functional density per unit area and reduce system power, as an alternative to costly sub 7nm CMOS technologies. However, as trendy as it may turn, there is no viable Electronic Design Automation (EDA) toolchain that allows to design ICs in 3D. Our work aims at developing tools that could be used in standard 2D EDA chains to deal with 3D ICs. Such tools will automatically transform any 2D design into an optimized 3D architecture by extracting a graph from the DEF file coming out from 2D synthesis and place&amp;route flow. Afterward, this graph can be partitioned automatically using state-of-the art graph partitioning tools.</p>                <p>In order to create the toolchain, we developed a custom DEF parser to answer specific and limited needs that existing solutions such as Verilog-perl or PyVerilog did not allow. The software scans the DEF to find all the gates, pins and nets in the given design. When analyzing nets, it also parses the routing information to determine the total length of the net, which will be needed in the partitioning phase.</p>                <p>In parallel with the DEF parsing (design input), the LEF technology file (technology input) is also parsed to fetch the characteristics of the gates that will be used later on in the clustering and partitioning steps.</p>                <p>Once the design has been parsed, it can be clusterized to reduce the problem complexity and the output is formatted to extract the underlying hypergraph.                The extraction makes use of standard Python structures such as dictionaries in order to quickly find links in the design and establish references between the vertices (i.e. clusters or gates) and edges (i.e. nets). When building the hypergraph, some metadata are linked to each vertex/edge (e.g. area, power, total length, total connections) to later set their weights that will be needed in the partitioning phase.</p>                <p>As soon as the design has been converted into a hypergraph, it is formatted in such a way so that it can be fed to the hMETIS package. Using the weights sets extracted during DEF/LEF parsing phase, hMETIS partitions the graph. The output is processed into  TCL directives that are then interpreted by a proprietary tool handling the 3D P&amp;R, or they can be used to automatically partition the post-synthesis gate-level netlist and thus be used with any EDA flow, including the open-source ones.</p>                <p><em>Quentin Delhaye, Dragomir Milojevic, Université libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium</em></p>",

                "description": "<p>In the past the definition of Design Rules has been a mess. Most EDA software provider (e.g. Autodesk, Altium, Cadence) have their own set of Design Rules which neither match the expectations of the users nor the requirements from the PCB manufacturers. Beside that the Design Rules are often misleading as they do not allow to describe what really breaks production or not. Because of that most PCB manufacturers give too loose rules which often break production for the customers.                An open and democratic format for Design Rules could solve this. We face the issue that at least three parties are involved in these rules which I believe can only be solved by an open source format. Because of this I talked to EDA software supplieres, PCB manufactures and users and asked what they are missing and expect from it.                Using this feedback I'd like to introduce our proposal and ask if and if yes, how work should be further organized. Depending on the projects schedule an practical implementation in Gerbv could be presented.</p>",

Did you find a source of trackpads for use in that laptop that you're thinking of designing?  Or did your search queries instead get completely and utterly swamped with thousands upon thousands of aliexpress pictures of the EXACT SAME Apple Trackpad for a 13in Macbook Pro?</p>                <p>What about LCDs?  Do you even know what type of LCD is commonly available right now?  Were you aware that MIPI is Cartelled? Or that the people telling you that eDP is \"The Future\" are trying to push a much higher-power-consumption design at you and they forgot to invite China-based Manufacturers to the closed-door meeting.  How can you <em>actually</em> find which LCDs are commonly manufactured and available in Shenzhen, so that you can begin the design right now before you take that expensive trip abroad.</p>                <p>And what about components?  If you've looked on taobao or aliexpress, you'll know that many of them are rip-offs, there's absolutely no datasheets, the vendors make pittance so they're extremely unlikely to answer your questions... so what <em>actual</em> use is this resource, to anyone?</p>                <p>This talk will help answer the paradox of bridging the gap between Shenzhen market prices and the Western and Libre mindsets for hardware design, allowing attendees to take proper advantage of the lower pricing of Shenzhen-sourced parts, and to avoid the nightmare scenario of designing a PCB only to find that its parts went End-of-Life in the Shenzhen markets many years ago, and that the last remaining parts available must be bought from Digikey and IMPORTED (back into China from where they originated!) with a whopping lead time and huge import tariffs of up to 40 percent.</p>",

                "description": "<p>In Linux 4.13, GPU performance counters were added to the kernel, dramatically expanding the information available to understand GPU performance bottlenecks on Intel platforms.  FrameRetrace exposes these counters in a responsive UI, providing a detailed cost analysis for every aspect of a frame's rendering.  The following live experiments allow a developer to alter the frame and immediately see the impact on both performance and rendering:</p>                <ul>                <li>shader editing and recompilation</li>                <li>changes to GL state settings</li>                <li>changes to uniforms values</li>                <li>experiments (simple shader, disable render)</li>                </ul>                <p>Because FrameRetrace is built on top of ApiTrace, it can analyze most OpenGL applications.  It can also provide parallel analysis of the same frame on Windows and Linux platforms, to highlight driver differences.  This key feature makes FrameRetrace especially powerful when enabling new hardware that has a well-supported driver for Windows.  Hardware teams from AMD and Broadcom have expressed interest in FrameRetrace for enabling their platforms.</p>                <p>The current feature set of FrameRetrace is compelling, and Mesa driver team has already fixed many driver issues based on findings from the tool.  I would like to encourage wider use of FrameRetrace, and solicit help in adding features -- especially support for AMD hardware.</p>                <p>Source and documentation available at:              https://github.com/janesma/apitrace/wiki/frameretrace-branch</p>",

When                Khronos published the first release of Vulkan, almost 2 years ago,                shaders used a binary format, called SPIR-V, originally developed                for use with OpenCL.</p>                <p>That means that the two major public 3D graphics API were using                different shading languages, making porting from one to the other more                complicated. Since then there were efforts to allow making this                easier.</p>                <p>On July 2016, the extension ARB<em>gl</em>spirv was approved by Khronos,                that allows a SPIR-V module to be specified as containing a                programmable shader stage, rather than using GLSL, whatever the source                language was used to create the SPIR-V module. This extension is now                part of OpenGL 4.6 core, making it mandatory for any driver that wants                to support this version.</p>                <p>This talk introduces the extension, what advantages provides, and                explain how it was implemented for the Mesa driver.</p>",

The Pixel Format Guide aims to become a comprehensive reference for pixel format definitions used by such APIs and projects, describing aspects as component bit order and dependence on system endianness. The guide provides both a collection of documents describing how to interpret the definitions, and a python tool and library (called pfg) that allows automatic interpretation of pixel format definitions and operations on them. The Pixel Format Guide currently supports 12 pixel format families for a total of 541 format definitions.</p>                <p>The pfg python library allows users to leverage all the information and capabilities of the tool to create their own custom scripts.

A movement towards a unified windowing method and unified decoding methods has started. For Kodi version 18 a Direct Rendering Manager / Kernel Mode Setting (DRM/KMS) windowing method has been implemented. This allows any device that has a Linux kernel DRM driver to run kodi. The next step is video decoding, where each SBC has it's own specific decoder and software to run it. The Linux kernel implements a Video4Linux2 (V4L2) subsystem where drivers can register a decoder to be used under a common API. Kodi needs to be able to use a zero-copy path in order to display these decoded frames on the screen. For this to happen we need to use DRM-PRIME buffer sharing and specific EGL extensions to present the frames. All this together will allow Kodi 18 to run on a vast variety of SBCs that have DRM driver and a V4L2 driver available.</p>",
                "description": "<p>In order for Kodi to present decoded frames along with the GUI multiple hardware planes are needed. To use multiple planes we will make use of the DRM subsystem. Atomic DRM allows control over each page flip and what is presented by each plane within one atomic commit. In Kodi this allows showing the Kodi GUI in the overlay plane and the decoded video frames in the primary plane. The decoded video frames exit the decoder in a semi-planar YUV format called NV12 (other formats may be possible as well). These NV12 frames can be presented directly in the primary plane and the DRM subsystem handles the scaling and rotation.</p>                <p>Presenting directly to a DRM plane has some downsides that need to be addressed. Depending on the DRM driver things like scaling and deinterlacing may not be supported. In these cases a separate rendering method has to be used. This other rendering method is entirely done in OpenGLES using the EGL extension EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import. This method allows directly importing the NV12 video frame into OpenGLES and manipulation can be done from there via GLSL shaders. Kodi already implements shaders that do the YUV to RGB conversion needed to output the image to the display. These shaders also implement scaling via various methods (lanczos, spline36, etc) and deinterlacing via bobbing.</p>                <p>All this together will allow SBCs such as NXP i.MX6, Allwinner H3, Rockchip 3288 and 3328, Qualcomm Dragonboard 410c, and many more to work with Kodi without implementing any new methods. This work is underway is largely merged into Kodi master already.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Managing shader compilation in an OpenGL driver is challenging, because the final shader binary may depend not only on the shader source, but also on other state in the OpenGL pipeline such as framebuffer state, blending, and vertex array. When a shader is used in a new pipeline configuration, the driver may have to recompile it. This could cause noticeable stalls in some games. While on-disk shader caches can alleviate the problem somewhat, they cannot cover all cases. The approach taken by radeonsi is to split shaders into multiple parts, such as a prolog, a main part, and an epilog. In many cases, the effects of changing OpenGL states can be captured by only recompiling the prolog and epilog, which is sufficiently faster to virtually eliminate stalls.</p>                <p>The .text segments of these shader parts, which the driver originally gets in ELF format from the LLVM backend, are simply pasted together. This means that we cannot currently use most of the features of ELF which are taken for granted in the CPU world. Most interesting to us would be: putting large constant data into a .rodata segment, and representing LDS memory (a fast on-chip memory) as a proper ELF data segment. I will present a plan to introduce a proper ELF-based dynamic linking step into the driver to enable these features.</p>                <p>I also plan to present a brief update on the transition from TGSI to NIR as intermediate representation.</p>",

                "description": "<p>If you’ve ever hooked up a Linux computer to a DisplayPort monitor or daisy chained multiple DP MST monitors and encountered only a flickering or blank screen, then the recent Linux Kernel update will fix it for you. DP is far from being a dumb cable and requires that the entire graphics stack works together to gracefully handle mode failures and recover them. Achieving DP compliance requires that the kernel drivers, hotplug events and the userspace compositors all work together to render every frame at requested rate e.g by handling link failure.                The atomic kernel modesetting infrastructure is based on an underlying assumption that \"Atomic check guarantees the requested mode and that commit should never fail\". Although this holds good in case of all GPU parameters checks and commits, it does not validate the DP physical cable and DP link training failure can result in an atomic commit failure resulting into black screens.                This talk will educate folks on the fix that was required to handle these atomic modeset failures in case of display port and how that was implemented across the entire graphics stack making it display port compliant. This solution was upstreamed to Linux kernel 4.12 and Xserver 1.19.3. through this talk Manasi will also share her journey through iterating designs and working together with upstream maintainers, collaborating with X-server community and finally designing and upstreaming a solution that is used by i915 and can be incorporated by all other open source DRM drivers.</p>",

There are many who remember a time before open source. Of those, most helped to shape the philosophy, laws, governance, and policies which are the foundation of the free and open source movement we enjoy today.</p>                <p>But what happens when these people decide to retire? Who will carry the baton and lead the movement?</p>                <p>Thankfully these people are still with us, helping to craft and lead FOSS, but there are very few younger individuals among their ranks. As we look at the next horizon for FOSS, we must consider who will take us there.

What’s more, the feedback will give you the input you need to correct any errors you have in fact made. We’ll use real world examples to look at some best practices, including Sun’s comprehensive FAQ for open sourcing Java.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Perhaps you’re in a company, trying to engage developers, leverage the FLOSS development model, and participate in communities important for your business. Maybe you’re part of a developer community eager to further your progress, and intent on changing your contract with contributors and downstream users. When you’re in the development and FLOSS world, inevitably you’ll have complicated, controversial, or unpopular news to deliver as things move forward, and skeptics ready to believe the worst! A comprehensive, transparent, honest FAQ document can help in ways you might not expect.</p>                <p>In this talk, we’ll look at how to use an FAQ to:</p>                <p>o  Organize the effort.                o  Force decision makers and leaders to decide on goals, craft a coherent strategy, and understand and accept the tradeoffs.                o  Internally sell transparency and scrupulous honesty as essential to success.                o  Help the legal team be a paer, instead of just saying “no”.                o  Simplify and accelerate communications and make the Marketing Department an ally.</p>                <p>We’ll be using a bit of FLOSS history to illustrate our points - Sun’s Open Source Java Initiative.</p>                <p>Java wasn’t always Free Software. By 2005, Sun was making a lot of money with its staunchly proprietary Java platform. Richard Stallman called it a seductive “trap”. Under pressure from FLOSS community leaders to open source Java and turn it into a compelling example of the new model, Sun listened.</p>                <p>Those of us on the Java team were just as surprised as the rest of the software world by the announcement. Immediately, the questions started pouring in: Which license? How to encourage and manage contributions? What happens to the brand, and to Java’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” compatibility promise? How does Sun continue to make money with Java, when the code is out there for anyone to use without paying a fee?</p>                <p>Sun didn’t know the answers. And these questions were in the minds of Sun’s customers, competitors, and knowledgeable FLOSS leaders. We needed a way to:</p>                <p>o  Answer the hard questions consistently and in one place so everyone would know.                o  Get the whole company on board, including management, lawyers, salespeople, engineers, and marketing personnel.                o  Communicate the answers successfully to diverse internal and external audiences.                o  Convince skeptics on both sides that this initiative would succeed in future-proofing Java’s business while keeping the platform relevant and exciting.</p>                <p>Thus was born the “Open Source Java FAQ”, which was inspired by an earlier FAQ done for the Debian community, and grew to 200 questions. It would prove to be a key tool in solving these problems.</p>",

It's also helpful to implement some solid \"nothing's on fire today\" systems for maintaining low temperature group dynamics, a culture of openness and transparency around shared goals. For anyone who cares about the success of free and open source software, this work is critical in both the wider community and inside our individual projects.</p>                <p>So, what things could we stand to fix around here and what are the best strategies for fixing them? The best way to start a bug report is with a description of the expected or desired behavior.

If we want to analyze any Open Source development community, it's key to understand the relationships of the people that define that community. Open Source communities provide many ways for peers collaboration beyond participation in forums and mailing lists. In any case, people graph or network analysis is one the methodologies used for social interaction analysis.                During this talk, I'll show social network analysis with a free, open source software Kibana <a href=\"(http://dlumbrer.github.io/kbn_network\">plug-in</a> integrated in <a href=\"http://grimoirelab.github.io\">GrimoireLab</a>. I started this project during my degree thesis, 6 months ago, and once it was released everything has changed. People started to download the plugin and contribute to it. Now, the repository hosting the plugin has more than a hundred thousand clones and a hundred of daily visits.                The talk will show how to use the <a href=\"http://dlumbrer.github.io/kbn_network\">Network plugin</a> in order to analyze open source projects. I'm going to show data retrieved from an open source project and I will show that with differents types of networks/graphs.</p>",
                "description": "<p>This <a href=\"http://dlumbrer.github.io/kbn_network\">Kibana Network plugin</a> has, as the main aim, the integration of visualization systems of social networks in complex systems of visualization and data interaction based on open source. It relies on Kibana as a complex system of data visualization and ElasticSearch as the database. In order to integrate these visualization systems, a Kibana plugin has been developed to visualize this data in a social network way.                The plugin is an open source project, uses open source libraries, and it is completly integrated in Kibana (using its components). Hence, it's integrated in GrimoireLab to allow social network analysis in open source development communities.                The talk will show how to use, and create graphs with it. I will show how to import open source project data (e.g., commits, usernames, repositories, organizations, etc.) to ElasticSearch form GitHub (or other sources) using <a href=\"https://grimoirelab.github.io\">GrimoireLab</a>. I will build a graph visualization from scratch, showing its features and usability. You will see how simple it is to create a network that relates users with repositories, organizations, etc. in order to show how a community is related in their own projects.                Finally, the talk will explain how a graph/network can be integrated into a dashboard with other visualizations, and how to deal with real time data and filters in order to show what it's happen in the community instantly.                Since I started its development, many people contributed, tested and downloaded it. As a consequence, the plugin has evolved and adapted to the community needs. The plugin has had a big impact in the ElasticSearch and Kibana community, and currently it has more than a hundred thousand clones and it receives a hundred of daily visits. Kickstarting and managing this open source project has been a great experience for me, and now I understand more how to contribute, get involved and improve a project in a big open source community. And I hope you can find it useful for your communities too.</p>                <ul>                <li><p><a href=\"http://dlumbrer.github.io/kbn_network\">Network plugin</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/dlumbrer/kbn_network\">Network plugin Repo</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"https://grimoirelab.github.io\">GrimoireLab</a></p></li>                </ul>                ",

Instead of starting from scratch, and creating a new community for every single cause, this talk will explore how existing communities can be brought together, if there is room for cooperation between projects and if the founders are ready to set their egos aside. It be based on the case study of the Social-Digital Innovation Initiative, which aims at bringing social good and tech together, also through communities.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Bringing communities together worldwide is hard, and it's especially hard to bring two completely different communities together. We at the Social-Digital Innovation Initiative are doing it step by step, country by country, region by region, trying to build bridges between people trying to solve social problems (i.e. social entrepreneurs - the word social doesn't refer to social networks here) and those who know how tech could help. All this happens offline at barcamps and online, on our discourse. But is this really the most efficient way? Do you always have to set up a new community for a cause or a project? Or is it inevitable because people need to feel like they belong - and projects need to measure their impact? What if we stopped trying to set up communities for each and every little project, put the founders' egos aside and teamed up? Could we bring existing communities together cooperatively and help them cross-pollinate?</p>",

Anyone can join easily - the code is on Github, and it's just a matter of 2 commands in your terminal to get a local debugger running!</p>                <p>The debugger is universal - it can debug any browser, node and mobile. The feature list is innovative and aimed to be the best debugging experience for React, Angular, Ember, RxJS and more types of apps. In addition, making contribution to the debugger together with top notch developers from all around the world is an exciting experience!</p>                <p>By the end of this talk you will have the tools to get into hacking on Firefox's debugger. I will introduce architecture and process of development, and make you feel comfortable to approach a world class open source project, and become a contributor to tomorrow’s JavaScript debugger.</p>",

Mozilla’s DeepSpeech and Common Voice projects are there to change this.                In contrast to classic STT approaches, DeepSpeech features a modern end-to-end deep learning solution. Based on Baidu's Deep Speech research paper, it trains a model by machine learning techniques. This model directly translates raw audio data into text - without any domain specific code in between.                To train systems like DeepSpeech, an extremely large amount of voice data is required. Most of the data used by large companies isn’t available to the majority of people. That's why Mozilla launched Common Voice, a project to help make voice recognition open to everyone.</p>",

The clear downside is development time: it can take several months or longer to produce a working, optimized unikernel, and up until now, the process needed to be repeated for each target application. There was no shared research and development on the building and creation of unikernels.</p>                <p>In this presentation we will introduce Unikraft, a new, open source Xen Project sub-project under the auspices of the Linux Foundation that seeks to automate the development process for unikernels. Unikraft decomposes operating systems and libraries into elementary modules called libraries (e.g., schedulers, memory allocators, drivers, filesystems, network stacks, etc) and then allows users to quickly pick and choose, through a menu, which components to use when building a unikernel. Once done, Unikraft builds one image per target “platform” (e.g., Xen, KVM or Linux user-space), severely reducing unikernel development time.  We will show a brief demo on how to use Unikraft, and cover the basics of the system including how to contribute to it.</p>",
                "description": "<p>We have spent quite a bit of our time over the last few years developing unikernels – specialized virtual machine images targeting specific applications. We have been particularly interested in them since because of their fantastic performance benefits: tiny memory footprints (hundreds of KBs or a few MBs), boot times comparable to those of processes, and small migration times, to name a few metrics.</p>                <p>Despite the fact that this work and work from several others is proof of their potential, unikernels have yet to see massive adoption. One of the main showstoppers is development time: for instance, developing Minipython [4], a MicroPython unikernel, took the better part of 3 months to put together and test. ClickOS [5], a unikernel for NFV, was the result of a couple of years of work. What’s particularly bad about this development model besides the considerable time spent is that each unikernel was basically a “throwaway”: every time we wanted to create a new unikernel targeting a different application, we would start more or less from scratch.</p>              <p>One thing we did do to try to re-use the work a bit more was to create a separate repo consisting of a “toolstack” that would contain functionality useful to multiple unikernels, mostly platform-independent versions of newlib and lwip (a C library and network stack intended for embedded systems).</p>              <p>That got us thinking that we should take that a (much bigger) step further: wouldn’t it be great to be able to very quickly choose, perhaps from a menu, the bits of functionality that we want for a unikernel, and to have a system automatically build all of these pieces together into a working image? It would also be great if we could choose multiple platforms (e.g., Xen, KVM, bare metal) without having to do additional work for each of them.</p>              <p>The result of that thought process is Unikraft. Unikraft decomposes operating systems into elementary pieces called libraries (e.g., schedulers, memory allocators, drivers, filesystems, network stacks, etc.) that users can then pick and choose from, using a menu, to quickly build images tailored to the needs of specific applications.</p>",

In this talk, we take a peek under the nova hood to see how this feature works and how it ties into earlier work in this area (hint: KVM + libvirt do most of the heavy lifting). We then demonstrate why this matters and how you can use this feature and others like it in your own applications.</p>",

We had to optimize that hardware, from storage IOPS to real time UI events, while keeping in mind network traffic and system reliability.</p>                <p>We use NVME to do write-cache, 10 Gbps copper networks, gaming mainboards, mainstream processors, raspberry pi and old computers as thin clients. We built NAS in cluster systems with pacemaker and drbd, incremental qcows disk storage to lower storage footprint. Hypervisor statistics about use and resource consumption brings orquestration oriented to desktop performance.</p>                <p>IsardVDI can be quickly deployed with docker containers. Some of the technologies used are Libvirt, Spice, EnhanceIO, Pacemaker, DRBD, Python3,                WebSockets, RethinkDB, ...</p>",

Wish no more, because we're going to handle that with User Session Recording support in Cockpit!</p>",
                "description": "<p>As part of our User Session Recording project, Red Hat Common Logging team is working with developers of Cockpit, a server management Web UI, to implement support for configuring recording, searching, correlation, and playback of users' terminal sessions, all in your browser! On this session we are going to introduce the new effort, show what's working already, present further plans for development, answer your questions, and eagerly listen to any feedback you might have!</p>                <p>The Red Hat's User Session Recording project is aiming at building an enterprise-ready solution for centralized recording of user sessions, for audit, forensics and compliance purposes. The solution involves integration with Linux audit logging system, FreeIPA identity management, Elasticsearch storage, and integration into UIs of various management solutions, such as OpenShift, CloudForms, etc. As part of developing our playback and correlation UI component, we're implementing Session Recording support in Cockpit.</p>                <p>Cockpit is a feature-rich server management Web UI with a new twist: it doesn't take over your system and doesn't force you to relinquish direct control over your system. Instead it lets you jump freely between the command line and the browser at any time you want. You can immediately see the changes you did on the command line in your browser and vice versa. That facilitates gradual learning and simplifies complicated tasks. Cockpit supports a variety of Linux distributions and releases, does its own releases very frequently, and achieves that via advanced and comprehensive continuous integration system, which is a wonder on its own.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The talk will be divided basically in 4 parts:</p>                <p>1) Describing what Fleet Commander is (and what it's not intended for):                Fleet Commander is an integrated solution for large Linux desktop deployments that provides a configuration management interface that is controlled centrally and that covers desktop, applications and network configuration. Last but not least, Neither Ansible nor Puppet could solve the core problems of Desktop Session Configuration Management, which is what drove the Fleet Commander development.</p>                <p>2) Describing Fleet Commander interaction with freeIPA and SSSD:              Fleet Commander relies on freeIPA, which provides a standalone plugin for desktop profile management, to store the profile data and its assignments to users, groups and hosts from the administrator point-of-view. From the client point-of-view, Fleet Commander relies on SSSD to fetch the the profile data at users' login time and notify Fleet Commander whenever new profiles have to be applied.</p>                <p>3) A short Demo about the current status of the project:              This will be the first time that Fleet Commander project will be Demo'ed after the freeIPA/SSSD integration.</p>                <p>4) Plans for the future:              A quick discussion about what are the plans for the future, including a way to manage profile data in case of direct integration between Linux clients and Active Directory servers (GPO is the key here!)</p>",

There will be a quick overview of the history of the TSDB of Prometheus, giving context to the new storage engine in the 2.0 release and how it helps with the above technical problems. Following that will be a look at service discovery to find what to monitor in dynamic environments, the aggregation abilities of PromQL and how these can be combined to perform symptom rather than cause based alerting using techniques such as the RED method.</p>",

                "abstract": "<p>There's an old joke about a new bride who prepares her first big                dinner for her new husband.  She's making her mother's brisket recipe                which starts by cutting the ends off of the roast.  Her husband asks                her why she cuts the ends off. She says she does it because that's the                way her mother always did it.  She asks her mother and her mother says                \"That's the way your grandmother always did it\".  She asks her                grandmother and her grandmother says \"That's the only way it would fit                in my pan\".  There's a lot of folklore and myth surrounding Java                garbage collection performance, most of which is obsolete, irrelevant                to your application, or was never really right in the first place.</p>                <p>So how do we evaluate a GC algorithm?  We can measure various metrics:              end to end run time, maximum pause time, average pause time,                percentage of the cpu given to the Java threads, memory footprint,                micro benchmarks, ...  This talk will focus on ten (give or take)                metrics/tools we can use to evaluate garbage collection performance.                This isn't a comparison of OpenJDK collectors, it's a discussion of                what characteristics are important in a good garbage collector and how                to measure them.</p>",

However, the JVM manages more                data than just bytecode, Java objects  JITted code. In order to manage                heap memory and to ensure correct execution, the JVM and JITted code                need to retain and, occasionally, interrogate details of the loaded                class base. Bytecode is not a very 'efficient' representation for this                purpose, nor does it include details of runtime-derived info like class                and method implementation dependencies, compile history and JITted code                status, or execution profiles.</p>                <p>So, the JVM throws away most bytecode after parsing, in its place                constructing and maintaining its own 'efficient' in-memory (C++) data                structures which model both the loaded class and method base and                runtime-derived state. This is what is known as Class Metadata. Class                Metadata is a significant component of the Native Memory storage                allocated and managed by the JVM, alongside JIT Compiler Metadata, GC                Metadata, Thread Metadata, etc. For small applications that don't create                a large number of Java objects Metadata can constitute a large portion                of a Java application's resident memory set.</p>                <p>This talk will begin by describing how to use the jcmd tool to measure                summary JVM Native Memory storage costs, including overall Class                Metadata costs. It will also show how to use jcmd to obtain a detailed                breakdown of the latter costs, splitting the overheads along two axes:              firstly, by class; and secondly, dividing per-class costs into separate                sub-costs associated with different component subsets of the class                model: classes per se, constant pools, methods and annotations.</p>                <p>I will go on to explain how Class Metadata is carved out of the memory                regions managed by the JVM's Native Memory allocation routines and                detail the memory layout of the various C++ types which define the                elements of the Class Metadata model, thereby clarifying some of the                more detailed statistics available in jcmd output. Real-life use cases                will be employed to explain how specific costs arise from code design                choices and to suggest how alternative choices might increase or                decrease Class Metadata costs.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The STM8 is a popular 8-bit architecture by ST Microelectronics commonly used in household electronics, automotive application and industrial controls. For quite a while there were no free tools, and the irregular architecture makes it hard to support in GCC or LLVM.                In recent years free tools for it started to appear and now form a free toolchain that surpassed preexisting non-free ones.                The most important part is the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC). New tree-decomposition-based algorithms from recent compiler research have been implemented in SDCC, including a new register allocator particularly suited to irregular architectures with few registers.                SDCC quickly surpassed the non-free compiler in standard compliance and OS support and generates substantially faster integer code.                Programs can be flashed by stcgal (via a serial link on STM8 devices that have a bootloader) and stm8flash (via the SWIM interface of ST-LINK hardware).                OpenOCD and GDB allow on-target debugging via the ST-LINK. IDEs complete the development environment.                However, stcgal still needs non-free binary blobs for use with some devices and the ST-LINK has non-free firmware. SDCC still falls short in floating-point performance. While there are some ports of free RTOSes that use the free toolchain for the STM8, more would be desirable.</p>",

In this presentation, Leon Anavi will share his experience how to use free and open source software for making high-quality entirely open source low-cost lighting solutions using 12V RGB LED strips.</p>                <p>Unlike Phillips Hue or IKEA Trådfri, the open source hardware lighting solutions are more flexible and developer friendly. They can be easily integrated with various free and open source software platforms for home automation such as Home Assistant. The practical examples in this presentation will be based on the open source hardware Raspberry Pi add-on board ANAVI Light pHAT available at GitHub under CC BY-SA 4.0 license and a work in progress device with ESP8266. Both devices have 2 layer printed circuit boards made with the free and open source software electronics design automation suite KiCAD. Tips for avoiding common pitfalls and mistakes as well as recommendations for optimization of the SMT and THT assembly with be shared.</p>                <p>Home Assistant is written in Python 3 and runs perfectly on a Raspberry Pi. Out of the box it supports popular mass market Internet of Things such as IKEA Trådfri, Philips Hue, Google Assistant, Alexa / Amazon Echo, Nest, KODI and many more. Furthermore it allows straight-forward integration of other embedded devices that support the machine-to-machine protocol MQTT using the so called MQTT JSON Light component. MQTT broker, such as the open source Mosquitto, is required to distribute the messages in real time among all hardware devices in the lighting solution.</p>                <p>The presentation is appropriate for open source enthusiasts, engineers, students and even beginners interested in combining open source hardware with free and open source software.</p>",

The syslog-ng application is an enhanced logging daemon, with a focus on portability and central log collection. It collects logs from many different sources, processes and filters them, and finally it stores them or routes them for further analysis. IoT developers can get started with it quickly, as its configuration language is similar to programming languages.</p>                <p>From this session you will learn  how to use logging for collecting usage statistics, monitoring, security, or debugging running applications, using examples from syslog-ng. We will discuss some interesting use cases from a wide range IoT devices:              consumer devices, like the Amazon Kindle or the BMW i3 electric car                IT appliances, like NAS and network devices                industrial uses, like National Instruments devices</p>                <p>In addition to acting as a logging agent, syslog-ng can be your logserver and collect data from IoT devices. The syslog-ng application can parse incoming data for interesting information, anonymize it if required by compliance, and route results to the proper destination. Other than saving logs locally, you have many possibilities, including visualizing logs using Graphite, creating alerts using Riemann, analyzing them in Kibana, or saving them to Hadoop HDFS for long term storage.</p>",

                "description": "<p>An important but often neglected safety aspect of our society's critical infrastructure involves the security of embedded software in contexts such as the Internet of Things, smart cities or the smart grid.  In this talk I will present an approach to the security-conscious design of embedded control systems.  Our work is based on Sancus, a lightweight Trusted Computing platform and Protected Module Architectures (PMA, think of Intel SGX, but for 16-bit MCUs) and guarantees authenticity, integrity and confidentiality properties of event-driven distributed embedded applications.</p>                <p>Relying on a hardware-only Trusted Computing Base (TCB), Sancus makes it possible to protect individual software modules of an application against attacks from other modules or even from a malicious or misbehaving operating system.  Component isolation further leads a reduction of the size of these system's (security-) critical software stack, which allows us to analyse, test and even to formally verify critical modules in isolation.</p>                <p>We have worked on a number of compelling use cases for this technology, focusing on smart grid infrastructure and on an AUTOSAR-compliant security framework for automotive bus systems.  In these scenarios we observe a substantial reduction of the runtime software TCB (from 50 kLOC to less than 1 kLOC) while maintaining real-time responsiveness and adding protection against a wide range of network and software attacks.</p>                <p>Sancus is the only open-source Trusted Computing architecture currently available; hardware descriptions as well as infrastructure software are freely available.  We believe that this is essential to allow for the independent validation of the underlying security primitives and to                establish trust in the platform and in systems built on top of it.</p>",

This talks will provide the current state of play in using TPM 2.0 in place of crypto sticks and USB keys for secure key handling; including the algorithm agility of TPM 2.0 which finally provides a support for Elliptic Curve keys which have become the default recently.</p>",

We will report on the current state of that integration including demonstrations of how it works and future plans.

Well established tools are not well integrated for the use cases needed and it is easy to detect gaps in the overall toolchain for dedicated tasks. Instead of solving these challenges alone, wasting lots of money on the path, the Bosch division together with paers from the industry but also from other domains builds up a community to solve the toolchain challenge together in the OpenADx initiative. With this the paers expect a substantial saving on toolchain costs but also a better integration within organization and especially at the interfaces between cooperating organizations. This talk will present the approach and the current state of the community.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Automated driving solutions introduce a new complexity into the development of embedded systems in a car. This complexity rises with each level of control and autonomy of the automated driving systems. New tool categories have to be added like machine learning, but also existing technologies, like simulation, are stretched to their current limits. E.g., it is expected that the validation of a fully automated driving solution requires to do test drives in the amount of millions of kilometers. This results in the need for very complex simulation as part of the validation as well as the handling of extensive amounts of data in order to ensure quality at a realizable effort.</p>                <p>The toolchain for such challenges is complex and the integration of all the tools coming from different domains cost a lot of effort without a real competitive advantage towards the automated driving solution. Therefore, the Bosch Automated Driving division, together with Microsoft, is currently building up an ecosystem of companies within the industry including OEMs, tier 1 suppliers, tool vendors, research organisations but also paers from other industries like the IT industry. The intiative called OpenADx is supported by the Eclipse Foundation as a host for the activities.</p>                <p>The goal of this endeavor is to stop wasting money on the introduction of a proprietary toolchain in each of the companies and to share the development costs for the toolchain with paers from the industry. Besides the benefit of sharing the costs, the expected result is a better integration of the toolchain within the organizations, but especially also at the interface between cooperating organizations. For tool vendors and research organizations, the advantage of the approach is in the existence of an integration backbone which allows the provider to easily integrate new technology or tools into a working environment that runs in a multitude of customer organizations, instead of providing proprietary solutions for single customers.</p>                <p>The goal of the initiative is not to replace existing tools. There are many tools and technologies, be they commercial or open source, that solve perfectly their job and should do so in the future. The goal is to define development workflows and to support the integration of tools along those workflows as well as to fill gaps identified and not solved by existing tooling. This integration glue will be provided as open source software under the umbrella of the Eclipse Foundation.</p>                <p>The current state of the initiative is that it is currently searching for interested parties throughout the world. The goal is to make this an industry effort not driven by single paers that is big enough to propose and realize an industry standard for automated driving solution development. To get the ecosystem running with only a limited commitment necessary, the initiative starts small. Through a series of so-called Hackfests, i.e., 5 to 10 day Hackathon events, the interested parties get the chance to make first hand experience in the collaborative approach. Additionally, the members get to a common ground on the technologies available and the development approaches at hand in order to identify common integration goals which build the basis for first open source projects spanned from the ecosystem. Based on the experiences of these Hackfests, the members of the initiative will furthermore decide on topics like how to go public officially or how the intiative will be structured.</p>                <p>At the time of the talk, the first Hackfests have taken place in which we will have provided prototypical solutions for the area of closed-loop simulation of automated driving functions with a perfect perception and the handling of massive amounts of data in the toolchain. The results of these Hackfests will be shown in the presentation as well as an outlook on the further activities.</p>",

At the same time, these same organizations have struggled to leverage FOSS in an effort to make their work more participatory, sustainable, and effective.</p>                <p>Mainstream software often used in wealthier markets do not always fully meet the specialized needs of international development projects and the areas in which those projects are undertaken. Other fields have demonstrated the FOSS development model as a proven viable model to leverage global collaboration to share costs across institutions, increase the quality of products, and more rapidly innovate.</p>                <p>In the international development community, the results have been mixed. Relatively few of these FOSS projects have endured &amp; matured — when successful, enabling improved and sustained access to information and services that previously were out of reach for marginalized populations. Many efforts have failed, often due to preventable reasons.</p>                <p>These FOSS digital development projects usually struggle with lack of long-term investments in key focal areas such as community effectiveness &amp; product development. Without emphasis of these key considerations, they can rarely match the functionality and quality of their proprietary competitors. As a result, these FOSS projects can’t grow to the more advanced levels of maturity needed for widespread adoption throughout the development field.</p>                <p>In collaboration with paers around the world, the Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) at the United Nations Foundation is launching its Open Source Center, a multilateral participatory program designed to be a global focal point of FOSS digital development projects.

Programmers can use any of three kinds of languages to develop applications: C/C++, Java and HTML/JS. Elastos is different from an Android-like OS in at least four aspects:</p>                <ol>                <li><p>Elastos has a complete set of novel C/C++ APIs and frameworks, which correspond to the Java APIs and frameworks of Android. With better performance and a smaller footprint, Elastos is a better fit for embedded systems and machines with wireless peripherals. Elastos also supports almost all Android Java and JS APIs and frameworks. POSIX APIs are deprecated.</p></li>                <li><p>Elastos has a distributed OS runtime to guarantee end-to-end security and integrity across the Internet. With built-in metadata-driven reflection technology, Elastos can automatically generate code to bridge programming modules across languages and machine boundaries. In other words, applications, services and IoT devices are prohibited from sending/receiving network packets directly, in order to fence off network attacks initiated from third party software and hardware.</p></li>                <li><p>Elastos runtime has a pioneering, service-oriented architecture, designed ideally for containers/virtual-machines. An Elastos runtime can be thought of as a CppVM (vs. JavaVM) without a leaking bottom, i.e., there are no Java-Native-Interface (JNI) equivalent mechanisms to expose the underlying physical machine or host OS. This prevents the possibility of malicious code penetrating into the system layer.</p></li>                <li><p>Elastos is decentralized across the Internet, and utilizes blockchains to authenticate user IDs, application IDs, as well as machine IDs. To build a flourishing ecosystem, anybody may freely implement their own markets, social apps, search engines, location-based services, advertisement agents, and so on, while being rewarded with Elastos coins.</p></li>                </ol>                ",

Then, with the same toolkit, the data will be organized in ElasticSearch indexes, visualized in actionable dashboards, and summarized in reports. Some advanced analysis will also be presented on how to exploit the data using Python/Pandas and IPython/Jupyter Notebooks. The talk will be complemented with interesting insights on real FOSS projects.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Many free / open source software (FOSS) projects feature an open development model, with public software development repositories which anyone can browse. These repositories are normally used to find specific information, such a certain commit or a particular bug report. But they can also be mined to extract all relevant data, so that it can be analyzed to learn about any aspect of the project. This talk will explain the GrimoireLab method for doing that, which is based on organizing all that information in a database, which can be later analyzed. This approach allows for minimal impact on the project infrastructure, since data is retrieved only once, even if it later analyzed many times. It allows as well for efficiency and comfort when mining data for an analysis, since the results are readily available, databases can be shared and replicated at will, and queried them with any kind of tools is easy.</p>                <p>The tools that retrieve information from the repositories are grouped in the GrimoireLab toolset. It includes mature, widely tested programs capable of extracting information from most repositories used by FOSS projects of any scale. Many of them are agnostic with respect to the database used, although currently ElasticSearch is the best supported.</p>                <p>The produced databases can be exploited in several ways, of which two will be explained during the talk: using Python/Pandas to produce IPython/Jupyter Notebooks which analyze some aspect of the project; and using Python to feed a ElasticSearch cluster, with a Kibana front-end for visualizing in a flexible, powerful dashboard.</p>                <p>All these approaches can be used to understand general aspects of the project, such as how efficient are the code review or bug fixing processes, how diverse are contributions to the git repository, or how conversations in mailing lists or StackOverflow are shaped. But they can be used as well to drill down, and analyze the contributions by a certain developer, or the longer code review processes, or the contents of the most lively email and QA threads.</p>                <p>The talk will explain the whole process from data retrieval to visualization, and will show some specific cases of real world use, such as the dashboards produced for Eclipse, OPNFV, MediaWiki and many others. Some of the contents of the talk are described in detail in the online book GrimoireLab Training.</p>                <p>GrimoireLab is on of the systems produced by the CHAOSS Collaborative Project.</p>                <ul>                <li><p><a href=\"https://grimoirelab.github.io\">GrimoireLab</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"https://www.gitbook.com/book/grimoirelab/grimoirelab-training\">GrimoireLab Training</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"https://opendaylight.biterg.io\">OpenDayLight GrimoireLab Dashboard</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"http://opnfv.biterg.io\">OPNFV GrimoireLab Dashboard</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"http://wikimedia.biterg.io\">Wikimedia GrimoireLab Dashboard</a></p></li>                <li><p><a href=\"http://chaoss.community\">CHAOSS Collaborative Project</a></p></li>                </ul>                ",

This talk presents Perceval, a tool able to perform automatic and incremental data gathering from almost any tool related with contributing to Open Source development (e.g., source code management, issue tracking systems, mailing lists, forums). It hides the technical complexities related to data acquisition and eases the definition of analytics.

                "description": "<p>The arise of the Internet has radically changed how software is being developed. Over the years, platforms like GitHub, StackOverflow and Slack have became important tools to support, coordinate and promote the daily activities around software. This is specially true for Open Source projects, which rely heavily on distributed and collaborative development.</p>                <p>Beyond being successfully and increasingly adopted by both end-users and development teams, these telematic tools offer relevant data sources, which can be exploited by practitioners and researchers to describe, predict, and improve specific aspects of software projects.</p>                <p>However, accessing and gathering this data is often a time-consuming and an error-prone task, that entails many considerations and expertise. It may require to understand how to obtain an OAuth token (e.g., StackExchange, GitHub) or prepare storage to download the data (e.g., Git repositories, mailing list archives); when dealing with development support tools that expose their data via APIs, special attention has to be paid to the terms of service (e.g., an excessive number of requests could lead to temporary or permanent bans); recovery solutions to tackle connection problems when fetching remote data should also taken into account; storing the data already received and retrying failed API calls may speed up the overall gathering process and reduce the risk of corrupted data. Nonetheless, even if these problems are known, many practitioners tend to re-invent the wheel by retrieving the data themselves with ad-hoc scripts.</p>                <p>This talk introduces Perceval, a tool that simplifies the collection of project data by covering more than 20 popular tools and platforms related to contributing to Open Source development, thus enabling the definition of software analytics. Perceval is an industry-strength tool, that (i) allows to retrieve data from multiple sources in an easy and consistent way, (ii) offers the results in a the flexible JSON format, and (iii) gives the possibility to connect the results with analysis and/or visualization tools. Furthermore, it is easy to extend, allows cross-cutting analysis and provides incremental support (useful when analyzing large software projects).</p>",

Six years ago the author attempted to create an SoC pinmux: it took over two months.  Learning from that experience and instead writing a python program to represent the pinouts, adding new test scenarios instead took about an hour each, including altering the pinouts to best match the new scenario whilst still maintaining access to functions needed for all other scenarios as well.  Assuming the market assessments were correct, the design - which only requires a 300-pin BGA package - can be said to have been proven to successfully meet all four target markets.  Crucially with this approach, potential customers can be approached with the preliminary design, for their input and feedback <em>before</em> committing huge sums to design and tape-out actual silicon.</p>                <p>The output of the python program is a simple markdown page that can be used, without alteration, as the Reference Documentation should the SoC ever be created. In addition to the pinouts, the source of the design inspiration and guides utilised in the design has also been documented, so as to provide not just Reference Schematics and parts that are easily available in the Shenzhen / China markets, but also a logical justification for the actual choice of interfaces in each of the target usage scenarios.  Ultimately, it helps explain why low-cost embedded and mobile-class processors are designed the way that they are.</p>                <p>Also included is links to numerous sources of BSD-licensed and compatible LGPL-licensed hard macros (VLSI / VHDL) such as the ORSOC Graphics Accelerator, so that, if utilised, apart from the DDR3 hard macros (which the Shakti team plan to implement under a libre license) the entire SoC's full hardware-design source code is completely available under Libre Licenses.  With absolutely no proprietary firmware required whatsoever it has the potential to be one of the world's first ever mass-volume mobile-class quad-core 28nm 2.5ghz embedded SoCs that will be entirely libre right down to the bedrock.</p>",

All actions can be accessed via a <a href=\"http://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/api.html\">REST API</a>.</p>                <p>E.g. to enroll a Smartphone App like the Google Authenticator an administrator would have to issue an authentication request to                receive an authorization token:</p>                <pre><code>http POST https://your.privacyidea.com/auth username=administrator password=********              </code></pre>                <p>Then the administrator you enroll a token:</p>                <pre><code>http POST https://your.privacyidea.com/token/init serial=123456 genkey=1 type=totp authorization:&lt;authorizationtoken&gt;              </code></pre>                <p>The request would aleady return a QR Code image to be scanned with the smartphone.</p>                <p>Of course privacyIDEA provides a modern UI based on bootstrap and Angular, but this API already gives you an idea about the possibilities of automation.</p>                <h2>Event Handler</h2>                <p>In addition to this privacyIDEA comes with extremly flexible <a href=\"http://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eventhandler/index.html\">event handler framework</a>.                This allows the administrator to hook new actions to any event. These actions may only trigger based under certain conditions.                Triggered actions can be notifications, any kind of token events, federations with other privacyIDEA instances or any arbitrary shell script receiving certain parameters from privacyIDEA.</p>                <p>The talk will give you an idea, how you can use the privacyIDEA event handler framework to add privacyIDEA and 2FA management in your existing automated processes.</p>",

Snabb eases the effort to write such programs. Snabb fits in the category of user-space networking. Snabb by-passes the Linux kernel talking directly to the hardware. This makes Snabb a very convenient tool for high-performance networking. Unlike other user-space toolkits such as DPDK or VPP, Snabb is entirely developed in Lua which significantly lowers the adoption barrier.</p>                <p>In this talk I introduce the Snabb toolkit.

                "description": "<p>For over five years, a group of people have been working on ways to amplify and coordinate action of free software projects in Europe in the field of decentralized and distributed social media. From the P2P Meeting in Berlin, 2012, to the Umbrella project that gave birth to the Center for Cultivation of Technology, we've made serious advances towards our goal to find sustainable ways to promote and fund critical free software projects for the Federation, P2P social media, and privacy-by-design projects.</p>                <p>It's now time to bring EU funding to free software! With H2020/ICT-28 EU call for \"Future Hyper-connected Sociality\", we have a serious opportunity to bring funding to our community. We've setup the Public Universal Base: Libre Infrastructure Consortium (PUBLIC) to respond to ICT-28. PUBLIC is an EU Consortium to promote adoption of free software in Europe to build a lasting public infrastructure.</p>                <p>In this presentation we propose to introduce the EU consortium and our goals, and to explain how free software projects can participate to boost their finances. Via a procedure of \"Open Calls\", PUBLIC will be able to distribute funding to selected projects. We'll tell you how to best respond to those calls. We'll ask from you how to best frame the project to respond to your needs.</p>                <p>Outline:                - What is ICT-28                - What is PUBLIC &amp; PUBLIC's goal                - Open Calls &amp; how to respond to them                - Questions</p>",

Unlike a lot of communication technologies, this project works without any central server and uses a peer-to-peer network transport library which can be used by any application: <a href=\"https://opendht.net/\">OpenDHT</a>.</p>                <p>In 2017 Ring has seen a lot of improvements, and gets its first stable version last July, which provides a lot of new features . The project is available on a lot of platforms (Linux, BSD, Windows, UWP, MacOs, Android and iOS) and also supports SIP calls. During the last year, the communication reliability has been improved as well as the user experience. The OpenDHT library was enhanced in order to function via a proxy which offers the ability to easily work with HTTP requests.</p>                <p>Ring and OpenDHT's developers describe how this technology works. What problems they encountered and what solutions are implemented.

                "abstract": "<p>Over at Matrix.org we've spent a lot of the last year refining the Matrix protocol for open, secure, decentralised communication to make it more usable for larger scale usage.  One of the major recent additions has been the ability to group together sets of users and rooms into 'Communities' - equivalent to Slack Teams or Discord Servers, which give a way for existing projects and communities to give their users a much more focused and friendly environment for decentralised communication with Matrix.  In this talk we'll explain how Communities (aka Groups) work, how they're implemented, and how FLOSS projects in particular are using them and other recent features to escape the centralised tyranny of proprietary alternatives!</p>",
                "description": "<p>Everyone should be painfully familiar with the sinking feeling of their favourite online community (be that FLOSS or any other topic) fragmenting and getting trapped in proprietary communication technologies.  Matrix exists to defragment these silos and provide an open standard with open source implementations as a decentralised alternative.  One of the main improvements over the last year has been the introduction of Communities - a new feature in Matrix which provides a much-needed ability to define decentralised sets of users and groups alongside other community metadata (profile page, avatar, etc) to create a friendly home in Matrix for existing organisations of any kind.  This makes it way easier to migrate from proprietary silos into Matrix for communication and collaboration within a community, as rather than users being thrown head first into the open ocean of Matrix, anyone can now produce curated landing pages for given communities which users can participate in... without having to constantly sign up for new accounts or having communities locked into proprietary platforms.  Meanwhile bridges lets Matrix connect through to IRC, Slack, Discord, Telegram and others to fix the fragmentation problem.  We'll be showing off how folks like NextCloud, OpenSource Design, Status.im and Cosmos are using Communities already, and how they work under the hood.</p>                <p>Meanwhile, lots of other stuff has landed in Matrix this year focused on improving usability: entirely new UX for managing end-to-end encryption; all new native desktop clients (e.g. Nheko from the community); the addition of Widgets to embed arbitrary webapps into Matrix rooms; integrating with Jitsi for video conferencing and more!  Alongside Communities we'll show off the latest stuff and demonstrate how Matrix clients like Riot are becoming an increasingly viable open source alternative to Slack and friends.</p>",

Some free softwares exist to host your own videos but they don't address the money issue when too much videos are uploaded to your server, or if a video goes viral.</p>                <p>That's where PeerTube comes up! Servers are federated with ActivityPub, a federating protocol built by the W3C (already used in Mastodon) and they send the videos to web browsers with the help of WebTorrent (Bittorrent over WebRTC).                The videos are indexed accross federated servers so people can watch a video from instance A on the instance B's web interface. Here's the disk storage cost-killer: just upload your videos on your own instance or one you trust!                When viewers are watching the same video at the same time, thanks to WebTorrent, you don't get the videos only from the instance which hosts the video but from the other watchers too.

For example, it is always possible to guess certain information by learning some properties of the conversation beyond just the content, such as the length of the conversation, or who was involved, or even guessing a group of people that communicate with a certain frequency. These properties are called metadata and can be used to describe information even when the full data is not available.</p>                <p>Anonymity is a broad concept, and it can mean different things to different groups.

For the Tor network to function properly and to satisfy users' needs, we need a certain degree of diversity. We need diversity in the nodes comprising the network and in the user population sending traffic through it.

This lead us to the creation of PrivacyScore. PrivacyScore is a website scanning platform that simplifies the process of comparing security and privacy aspects of websites. PrivacyScore focuses on lists of websites, while existing scanners such as Webbkoll, Mozilla Observatory, Track the Trackers by Fraunhofer SIT, securityheaders.io, etc. focus on single sites. Furthermore, PrivacyScore is non-commercial and available as open source software. All recorded data is made available publicly for research purposes.</p>                <p>We believe that public benchmarks are a useful tool to improve security and privacy in the long run. On the one hand, such benchmarks can help with raising awareness of users, on the other hand a benchmarking platform like PrivacyScore can be of use for data protection agencies that want to or have to audit content providers in their jurisdiction, which will become more widespread in 2018 with the European general data protection regulation. The generated datasets are also of value for researchers: For instance, we are interested in analyzing whether public \"blaming and shaming\" poor performance within a peer group of sites creates an incentive for site operators to implement additional security and privacy measures.</p>                <p>In our talk we will present insights on the effectiveness of the public shaming approach that we have gained from running PrivacyScore in public since June 2017. We (and other users) have already created several lists to analyze security and privacy aspects of more than 18,000 sites. In some cases we were able to observe how web site operators react when they learn how their site ranks in comparison to their competitors.</p>",

There will also be a discussion of how to reuse the CryptPad architecture (and source code) in developing other security/privacy conscious webapps.</p>",
                "description": "<p>CryptPad was created to show the world that end-to-end encryption can be as easy to use as any ordinary webapp. CryptPad allows anonymous collaboration similarly to Etherpad but the URL contains a key after the # (which is never sent to the server). CryptPad also allows registration and then organization of pads in a \"CryptDrive\" which is itself encrypted using a key derived from the username and password. The result of this is no plaintext content is ever sent to the server.</p>                <p>Because the server is unaware of any of the content which is being edited, all operational transformation and realtime synchronization must happen on the client side. This was achieved using a library called ChainPad which uses a Merkel DAG (simplified block chain) in order to seek consensus on the official version of the document without the server's help. The server is little more then a dumb message relay.</p>                <p>However, one still must trust the validity of the javascript which is hosted on the server. In order to mitigate the risk of javascript vulnerabilities leaking the secret keys from CryptPad, the browser's Cross Origin Policy is leveraged with a novel use of cross-domain iframes. Attacks are also limited using Content Security Policy, a new feature which is present of modern browsers.</p>                <p>Still, the integrity of the javascript sent by the CryptPad server remains of great importance. Cryptography software is traditionally installed as an application which theoretically receives independent code review at each release. Unfortunately this defeats the simplicity and ease of adoption of a webapp. We are studying a possible solution using notarized code signing with a browser extension to validate it.</p>                <p>CryptPad is a research and development effort to explore new ways of improving security in collaborative web applications while maintaining the usability that people demand. This architecture is not confined to use only for realtime editing, it can be extended to many types of application. When you design the next privacy-conscious technology consider whether you should be requiring your users to install it.</p>",

Like                other HPC package managers, Spack was designed to build packages from                source.  However, we've recently added binary packaging capabilities,                which pose unique challenges for HPC environments.  Most binary                distributions assume a lowest-common-denominator architecture,                e.g. x86_64, and do not take advantage of vector instructions or                architecture-specific features.  Spack supports relocatable binaries for                specific OS releases, target architectures, MPI implementations, and                other very fine-grained build options.</p>                <p>This talk will introduce binary packaging in Spack and some of the open                infrastructure we have planned for distributing packages.  We'll talk                about challenges to providing binaries for a combinatorially large                package ecosystem, and what we're doing in Spack to address these                problems.  We'll also talk about challenges for implementing relocatable                binaries with a multi-compiler system like Spack.  Finally, We'll talk                about how Spack integrates with the US exsascale project's open source                software release plan, and how this will help glue together the HPC OSS                ecosystem as a whole.</p>",

From the operating system, to the deployment tools, monitoring, scheduling, and user software installation, everything is built from open source software that inter-operate gracefully. For instance, for deployment/provisioning, we use a combination of Ansible and Salt which we find work perfectly together even if they are often considered to be mutually exclusive.                This talk will share our experience with making FOSS software co-operate smoothly and will offer our point of view on choosing the right tool for the right job. It will also present some of the contributions we have made to the open source community.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Our software stack for the cluster is based on Slurm, OpenLDAP, Easybuild, Zabbix, with many side-services running on virtual machines in OpenStack. Management is performed with a trilogy of tools: Cobbler, Ansible and Salt, for production, and Openstack and Vagrant for development and staging.</p>                <p>Our contributions to the open source community include somme tools for Slurm, a web wizard for building submission scripts, and a tool that orchestrates the interplay between the LDAP system and the job submission program (Slurm).</p>",

In this talk, the main features of the language will be highlighted from the perspective of a “convert” coming from C++ and with a focus on scientific programming aspects. As an application, arrays and the work on making parts of the Trilinos library available will be discussed.</p>",
                "description": "<p>In the first part of the talk, a general overview of Julia will be presented. Julia is a typed language, where users can build their own types and write functions that operate on them. In this system, there are no “privileged” types, i.e. user defined types are treated equally to predefined types. A central concept in the system is “multiple dispatch”, where the function that is to be called is decided based on the passed arguments, thus making it possible to overload existing functions for new types. The decision on what function to call can happen both dynamically and at compile time, depending on the information available at compile time. As will be shown, this system, while very simple on the surface, results in surprisingly elegant and fast code.</p>                <p>In the second part, a concrete example, based on my Trilinos.jl package, will illustrate how an existing HPC library can be leveraged from within Julia. Current focus is on making the Belos solvers from Trilinos available, using the Tpetra sparse matrix stack. Views into the C++ data are available using the native Julia array syntax. As a concrete example, we have a 2D laplace example that demonstrates low-level linear system assembly using Julia but at the same speed as C++.</p>",

While these assumptions may still hold for traditional                simulation codes, many HPC clusters are now used for heterogeneous workloads.                Such workloads increasingly involve the integration of input data from a variety                of sources, notably in the life sciences.

                "description": "<p>HPC systems are by definition optimised to run user codes at the fastest                possible speed. Many of the normal safeguards and security procedures of Linux                systems are removed in furtherance of this goal. For example, firewalls are                often disabled and password-less SSH is usually enabled between nodes. The                parallel filesystems required for high performance often dictate further                security compromises. Normally these systems will be placed on an isolated                network, mitigating the risk to the wider infrastructure. In some commercial                organizations, an entire compute node will be dedicated to a user. Conversely,                the norm in academic clusters is for different users to share the nodes.</p>                <p>While the jobs running on these clusters were simulations, or were using data                without access concerns, none of the above approaches were problematic.

Backed by a high performance distributed file system (HopsFS) and the support for GPU sharing and management in the cluster manager (HopsYarn), the HopsWorks platform provides different flavors of Tensorflow-as-a-Service and it offers several possibilities for parallelizing and scaling out deep learning.                In this talk we are going to present how data scientists can use the Hops to perform parallel hyperparameter searching, or how they can run traditional distributed Tensorflow on a big data cluster with the TensorflowOnSpark framework.                In particular, during the talk, we are going to focus on the last generation of distributed Tensorflow architectures which borrow topology and communication pattern from the HPC field. In the Ring-AllReduce architecture, workers are organized in a ring topology and communicate gradients updates without incurring in the communication bottleneck with the parameter server(s) that traditional distributed Tensorflow suffers from. Ring-AllReduce has been used by Facebook and IBM to reduce the training time on Imagenet from 2 weeks to ~45minutes/1 hour.                Finally, we will show how you can recreate the popular game \"Quick, Draw!\" using HopsWorks and Tensorflow services provided the platform.</p>                <p>The code is available on Github at https://github.com/hopshadoop</p>",

For AI to be truly ubiquitous, its cost and energy efficiency needs to be improved. With the recent developments made in algorithms and MCUs, we introduce a deep-learning inferencing framework which runs TensorFlow models on MCU powered devices (with Mbed). In comparison to GPUs and mobile CPUs, MCU based devices are much more cost and power efficient. We believe this will open a new paradigm to AI and edge computing.</p>",
                "description": "<p>uTensor is a Machine Learning framework designed for IoT and embedded systems. Base on Mbed and TensorFlow, it is possible to run deep-learning models on an RTOS with memory requirement less than 256kB. Its binary size, ~50kB, is a desirable trait to most cost-sensitive systems.</p>                <p>  In comparison to a typical ML environment today, running on GPU and APUs, the resource reduction uTensor offers is significant. This is achieved with techniques such as: quantization, garbage collection, minimal code dependency and network-architecture design.</p>                <p>  The current frameworks consist of:</p>                <p>  Operators: quantized kernels where most of the computations take place                Tensors: data structure and memory abstraction                Context: graph definition and resource management                Code generator: an TensorFlow to uTensor export (WIP)</p>                <p> The framework serves as an environment to test out the latest idea in edge-computing, and, eventually hope to empower developers to create next generation smart-devices. Currently, the framework is able to run a 3-layer MLP on MNIST dataset with an accuracy of 97.1%. More operators, tools and optimizations are at the work.</p>                <p>  This talk aims to share the architecture, design decisions and backstories during the development.

As many folks have experienced, while we may wish that we spend all of our time playing with cool algorithms -- we often need to spend more of our time working on data prep. Having to copy our data slowly between the JVM and the target language of computation can remove much of the benefit of being able to access our specialized tooling. Thankfully, as illustrated in the soon to be released Spark 2.3, Apache Arrow and related tools offer the ability to reduce this overhead. This talk will explore how Arrow is being integrated into Spark, and how it can be integrated into other systems, but also limitations and places where Apache Arrow will not magically save us.</p>",

Using roles is easy, once you have digested all the documentation. For the uninitiated, though, the approach could be disappointing, and even give the feeling of not working at all. This quick demo will show some examples of how to deal with roles for several scenarios, how to assign roles to users, and how to use them effectively. Since there are several ways of assigning roles, the examples will cover both the roles granted as default and the cases where users can switch from one role to another within a session.</p>",

It can be easily extended by writing new plugins, whether for new transports for the Janus API, or for handling the media related to a PeerConnection in a custom way. Out of the box, Janus ships several plugins implementing different features (e.g., an SFU, an audio MCU, a SIP gateway, etc.), but developers interested in adding custom functionality can write their own plugins to handle media their own way. That said, Janus is written in C, which means that plugins are typically expected to be written in C as well. This can be an impediment for those not proficient with C as a programming language. As such, we recently released a new Janus plugin that acts as a bridge between the C code and Lua scripts: developers can write their logic in Lua, while leaving the media manipulation and routing to C helper methods that are exposed as Lua functions scripts can take advantage of. This presentation will introduce this plugin, how it works, and how it can be used to write custom logic with different Lua scripts: a couple of real use cases will be presented as a proof of concept.</p>",

                "abstract": "<p>How do we in 2017 create a mobile, cross-platform App to connect people in the internet to community GSM networks for calls and texts with a small team and limited time? SayCel and Rhizomatica, together with Altermundi and other individual contributors, have created an open source  WebRTC dialer as Progressive Web App and a WebRTC gateway to solve this not so trivial problem.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Community Cellular (GSM) networks usually connect to the PSTN through SIP trunks that are connected via an Internet back-haul. For outgoing calls, PSTN termination costs have to be paid, and for incoming calls the caller usually tediously needs to enter the extension after connecting to a dial-in number, and it's not possible to directly send text messages. This project uses WebRTC and Progressive Web App (PWA) technologies, implemented with the open source Kamailio+rtpEngine WebRTC gateway, SEMS, and an Angular app to connect people around the world on their smartphones and laptops directly to the users on the community cellular network for calls and texts. The open source webPh.one dialer is also an interesting technology base for other projects that need an App to connect to a SIP network. The talk gives a short intro to the two community cellular networks that have been connected (17 villages in Oaxaca, Mexico; PearlCel in Nicaragua), the problems that had to be solved and technologies used while doing so, and the solution this project created. It also gives our experience where today the limits of a pure PWA are, and shows our efforts to create docker-compose images for the infrastructure part.</p>                <p>About Rhizomatica: Through efforts around the world, Rhizomatica uses new information and communication technologies, especially mobile telephony, to facilitate community organization and personal and collective autonomy. Rhizomatica's approach combines regulatory activism and reform, development of decentralized telecommunications infrastructure, direct community involvement and participation, and critical engagement with new technologies. Rhizomatica works with TIC AC in Mexico, operating community communications networks of 17 indigenous villages in Oaxaca.</p>                <p>About SayCel: SayCel is a research and development company dedicated to creating communications and infrastructure solutions for developing communities. SayCel currently works with local governments on Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua to increase the mobile communications services in the region. SayCel installs wifi data backhaul, rural fiber, and ethernet over coax. SayCel provides maintenance and training and in return, local governments are able to have a sustainable communications utility that they can use to lower the cost of communication for citizens, increase efficiency in their local government process, improve security through a local 911 service, and assist in growing their local economies. SayCel was supported by NYU's RiskEcon Lab and UNICEF Innovation Fund for the development of this project.</p>",

MongooseIM is built with scaleability in mind exactly for that case - your app starts small and then grows to match your imagination. Let’s explore the many ways in which you can make it scale. We will cover the impact of using bigger machines, different clustering techniques, benefits and challenges of multi-cluster setups. All those options have their traps and limitations, which we will explore in detail. You will also learn what we do on daily basis to monitor, maintain and improve MongooseIM's scalability.</p>",

Your Dapps need to coordinate before sending a final transaction. For example a decentralised market or token exchange where two clients may need to settle a deal before actually initializing a transaction, or sensors of some kind aggregating data or updating one another.                Publish small amounts of information that don’t need to persist but instead live for a limited amount of time.  From minutes to several days.  If your data needs to live for longer than that, then nodes can be incentivised (from outside the protocol) using a token model for example to store and forward messages.                You wish to propagate time bound but non time critical updates to n recipients. For instance, tweets, weather updates, traffic reports, IOT metrics etc.</p>                <h1>Some specifics of the Whisper protocol are:</h1>                <p>  The API is only exposed to contracts, never to user accounts.                Low-bandwidth: Only designed for smaller data transfers.                Unpredictabe latency: Not designed for real-time communication of data.                1-1 or 1-N communication.                PoW (spam throttling) in Whisper</p>                <pre><code>  Whisper messages (envelopes) undergo a process called “sealing”, which basically incentivises users to spend computational resources prior to sending the message. Internally, sealing involves hashing contents of the message repeatedly into the smallest possible number.                What this means to you as a developer is that if you want your messages to have priority over others on the network, you’ll need to spend more computational resources “sealing” them. You can specify this through the `work` parameter when posting a new message. The more work that you perform locally, the faster your message will propagate through the network.                Note that there is no way to specify exact latency times, rather you can only estimate based on how much work you perform during the “sealing” process.                </code></pre>                <h1>TTL</h1>                <p>TTL is the amount of time your messages live on the network, specified in seconds.                Filtering                Whisper is low-level, meaning that it is identity-based instead of application-based. Messages, therefore, can be sent directly to another participant by using the recipient’s public key. Listeners on the other hand, can filter messages by specific senders or specific topics.                With <code>web3</code> you can listen for Whisper messages like this:</p>                <h1>Swarm</h1>                <p>Whisper in action for RTC.</p>                <p>Case study - Status.im                There is a clear trend towards mobile first computing and chat applications are the dominant medium for personal communication on mobile.

Originally focused on voice, aditionnal functionalities were rapidly added like video, instant messaging and presence. From the beginning, Linphone follows IETF's standards, for both media and signaling. On the signaling part, Linphone does implements many SIP based RFC for call establishment, presence and instant Messaging. Today, group chat function is widely available on most popular communication applications, specially in the closed source world. As a free SIP communication application, Linphone aims to provide a free alternative for group communication.</p>                <p>On SIP world, Group chat is handled as a particular case of realtime group communication. The basic RFC is the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4353, Rich Communication Service (RCS) endorses many conferencing RFCs to specify how group functions shall be implemented. For Linphone, we decided to follow the same path, but with always keeping in mind to avoid complex development not bringing essential functionality. Resulting implementation can be defined as an  \"Adhoc pager mode conferencing\" with the idea of Long Term Conference leveraging on SIMPLE IM for message transport instead of MSRP.</p>              <p>This discussion will focus on both interpretation we made of existing SIP standards, implementation challenges and future extensions.</p>",

If one disk or object-server fails then its data is always available on other object servers. Swift is able to apply this principle to not just disks and object servers but also independent availability zones and regions. This enables the deployment of so-called Global Clusters which provide a single object namespace spanning multiple geographically dispersed data-centres, each offering independent local access to object data.</p>                <p>This talk will describe some of the mechanisms that Swift provides for configuring and optimising Global Clusters. We will briefly describe how Swift's consistent hashing Ring maps objects to object servers and how that mapping algorithm can be configured to distribute copies of each object across data-centres. We will show how Swift's read and write affinity settings can be used to optimise WAN traffic in a Global Cluster. Finally we will discuss some of the challenges we faced when implementing Global Cluster support for erasure coded objects, and how those were overcome by enhancements to the Ring and the erasure coding write path.</p>",

To achieve this, Rust has a rich set of built-in testing tools for writing unit tests.</p>                <p>When writing unit tests, we often need to mock dependencies that are complex to set up or access external resources (e.g. databases and APIs).

                "description": "<p>In November of 2017, the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) held its first large-scale Hackfest. The DARPA Bay Area SDR Hackfest focused on using software defined radio (SDR) to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), otherwise known as drones. The week-long Hackfest involved a set of Missions that were tackled by eight teams selected earlier in the year, a series of speakers to give two talks per day, and an open Hacker Space to allow anyone who wanted room to hack, explore, and work on projects.</p>                <p>DARPA created this event to explore a number of questions. First, who else is working in the field of SDR and UAVs that might be able to contribute to the DARPA mission? What new ideas and innovations might prove significant to the future of SDR and UAV technology in the future? And how does free and open source software (FOSS) enable talented engineers and scientists to answer hard technical challenges quickly? The event produced interesting results, and in this talk, we will examine what came out of the Hackfest and think about the future purposes of these kinds of events and ways of engaging the developer communities.</p>",

Issues include frequency and time synchronization of the DVB-T receivers, mitigated by appropriate digital signal processing relying heavily on cross-correlations.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Passive radar uses existing non-cooperative emitters as signal sources for mapping non-cooperative target range and possibly velocity. The attractive features of this strategy is the lack of dedicated broadband source for RADAR application, low cost from the use of existing emitters, and stealth since the operator is undetectable. This measurement technique has become accessible to the amateur with the availability of low cost receivers ideally suited for software defined radio processing. In the framework of passive radar applications, two receivers must be synchronized to record simultaneously the reference channel and the signal reflected by the targets: cross correlation will then finely identify the reference signal delay in the measurement signal and allow for target identification. In the case of moving targets, a brute force approach similar to Doppler compensation in GPS acquisition is applied for the cross correlation to coherently accumulate energy: the range-Doppler maps hint at the distance to the target and its velocity. Most interestingly, in the latter context, clutter (signals reflected from static targets) is separated from the moving target which becomes well visible even in a complex environment.                In this presentation, we discuss the details of real time acquisition and signal post-processing for passive radar application, while addressing some of the challenges of diverting DVB-T receivers from their original application. While passive radar has been demonstrated with FM broadcast emitters, analog television emitters, or wifi, we shall here consider the broadband signal provided by digital terrestrial television broadcast signal.</p>",

This talk presents the implementation of an opportunistic spectrum scanner on a software-defined radio platform, whose aim is to continuously scan the RF spectrum and to detect whether any signals are present. The implementation is done on a USRP-N210 software-defined radio, a popular and cheap model. One major bottleneck of USRP-based implementations is the limited CPU computation power, which does not allow to process RF signals at high sample rates continuously. In the proposed implementation, most computation is done on the USRP FPGA, such that the host CPU is relieved and is only used to store data and coordinate the scanning. We present the details of the FPGA and the software architecture, as well as some experimental results that show the efficiency of the proposed spectrum scanner.</p>",

In this presentation, we will discuss the various processing stages taking place on the LoRa PHY layer, including coding, whitening, interleaving, modulation and preamble detection. We will subsequently learn how hardware LoRa radios can be reverse engineered in order to build our own LoRa decoder with GNU Radio and software defined radios. The concept of PHY-layer fingerprinting will also be briefly explained, showing how we can identify individual LoRa radios using only their raw radio signals and a neural network. Finally, we will see how software defined radios can be leveraged to perform electromagnetic side-channel attacks on the AES encryption scheme, which is used by LoRa and various other wireless protocols. Such attacks enable the recovery of an unknown secret key given a set of known plaintexts and proximal measurements of the electromagnetic spectrum taken during the encryption process.</p>",

Pulling the data directly out of the Weather Station by the port provided was not going to be an option.</p>                <p>Instead Open Source software came to the rescue; in the form of a Arduino Sketch implementing Manchester Encoding with a €2 RXB6 module.

The successful deployment and data reception of the UPSat satellite, high power amateur rocket launches and realtime telemetry decoding, automatic decoding of LEO satellite signals from our crowd-sourced network of ground stations are some of the milestones achieved. And all these with the help of Software Defined Radios!</p>                <p>In this talk, we present briefly the UPSat and the High Power Rocketry project and then the version 3 of the SatNOGS project. In the new version we have developed several decoders that operate in realtime during a LEO satellite pass. Combined with the SatNOGS rotator that tries to point as accurate as possible to the satellite trajectory, the decoder searches for transmitted frames. The successfully decoded frames are then uploaded automatically on the SatNOGS database for visualization and further analysis.</p>                <p>Currently, SatNOGS project incorporates decoders for many popular in LEO satellite missions transmission schemes such as AFSK1200, APRS1200, (G)FSK9600, APRS9600, APT, DUV, CW, LRPT using the GNU-Radio toolkit. In addition, decoders for APT and LRPT are producing on the fly the weather images transmitted by the corresponding meteorological satellites. For the most interesting of the available decoders, we present the design and the implementation details among with a live decoding demo from a IQ captured observation.</p>                <p>All of the available decoders are running in realtime on the RPi3 platform. To achieve this, several design decisions were made (RF performance vs realtime operation) and we discuss some of them.</p>",

Currently typical use of DNS by applications is limited to forwarding requests to the system's stub resolver, which in turn simply forwards it to the recursive resolver in the network which does all the heavy lifting; iterate over the authoritatives, secure the lookups with DNSSEC etc.  This first-mile in the DNS eco-system (from application, via stub to the recursive resolver) is completely insecure and exposed. This makes the use of DANE (a secure alternative to the flawed CA based PKIX) impossible and also leaves end-users unprotected to DNS based connection hijacking and very exposed to eavesdropping attacks!</p>                <p>To deliver DANE and Privacy to the end-user, we need to address these issues as close to the end-user as possible.

                "description": "<p>Snowshoe spam is a type of spam that is notoriously hard to detect. Anti-abuse vendors estimate that 15% of spam can be classified as snowshoe spam. Differently from regular spam, snowshoe spammers distribute sending of spam over many hosts, in order to evade detection by spam reputation systems (blacklists). To be successful spammers need to appear as legitimate as possible, for example, by adopting email best practices, such as the Sender Policy Framework (SPF). This requires spammers to register and configure legitimate DNS domains.</p>                <p>Many previous studies have relied on DNS data to detect spam. However, this often happens based on passive DNS data. This limits detection to domains that have actually been used and have been observed on passive DNS sensors.</p>                <p>To overcome this limitation, we take a different approach. We make use of active DNS measurements, covering more than 60% of the global DNS namespace, in combination with machine learning to identify malicious domains crafted for snowshoe spam. Our results show that we are able to detect snowshoe spam domains with a precision of over 93%.</p>                <p>More importantly, we are able to detect a significant fraction of the malicious domains up to 100 days earlier than existing blacklists, which suggests our method can give us a time advantage in the fight against spam. In addition to testing the efficacy of our approach in comparison to existing blacklists, we validated our approach over a 3-month period in an actual mail filter system at a major Dutch network operator. Not only did this demonstrate that our approach works in practice, the operator has actually decided to deploy our method in production, based on the results obtained.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Unlike HTTP and Web privacy, the issue of privacy for DNS users was never a hot topic. There are no specific rules or regulations about it, and the typical Data Protection Agency, GDPR or not GDPR, is not too interested in the subject. But DNS traffic can be very revealing and has already been used to identify things such as malware communicating with a C&amp;C. If DNS surveillance can be done for the good, it can certainly also be done for evil purposes.</p>                <p>This is what motivated the Internet Engineering Task Force to start a work at the Vancouver meeting in november 2013, with a more official start at the London meeting in march 2014. The project followed the classical steps: describing the problem, the threat model, the actual rissk (this is now documented in RFC 7626), then trying to find solutions. While many geeks, when asked about privacy, immediately scream \"encryption\", privacy actually requires TWO things: encryption to protect against third parties, AND data minimisation, to protect you against the servers you talk to. Hence the development of two solutions, encryption with TLS (RFC 7858) and QNAME minimisation (RFC 7816).</p>                <p>There is also running code. The Unbound DNS resolver already knows how to encrypt (upstream and downstream), and can also perform QNAME minimisation, like the Knot resolver. The excellent getdns library also speaks DNS-over-TLS, allowing things like a monitoring plugin to monitor your DNS-over-TLS servers. Android has now DNS-over-TLS in its code base.</p>                <p>And there are some public deployments with this technology. The OpenWrt router Turris Omnia already ships, by default, with QNAME minimisation enabled. The Quad9 public DNS resolver accepts DNS-over-TLS.</p>                <p>What can we expect in the future? There are some projects to allow encryption between resolver and authoritative server (RFC 7858 only cobvers the stub-to-resolver case), to add padding to more TLS requests (getdns and Knot already do it), but most of the work will probably be on the code and deployment.</p>",

When they appeared, game development was limited to commercial developers and usually done in assembler only.                Today, free tools allow anyone to develop for them with relative ease, also in C. The ColecoVision and Sega Master System are popular video game systems of the 1980s. The central part of the free toolchain is the Small Device C Compiler (SDCC), which features some optimizations particularly suited to the irregular architectures, allowing SDCC to generate efficient code for the Z80 (and some other architectures relevant to retrogaming, such as the CPU used in the Game Boy). SDCC is also used as part of larger  retrocomputing / -gaming tools, such as z88dk and 8bit Workshop.                Besides all being Z80-based, the ColecoVision and the Sega 8-bit systems also use similar graphics and sound chips. This allows to target the simultaneously in game development, which is supported by cross-platform libraries.                Some new games have been released on cartridges. Sometimes cartridges from old games are reused, but there are also new PCB designs and newly made game cartridges.</p>",

Furthermore Home Assistant provides components for easy integration of Internet of Things through the machine-to-machine protocol MQTT. This presentation will focus on practical examples for using the MQTT JSON Light component for integrating two type of devices controlling 12V RGB LED strips: Raspberry Pi with the open source hardware add-on board ANAVI Light pHAT and the another open source hardware devices with ESP8266 - the cheap WiFi microcontroller compatible with the Arduino IDE. The printed circuit boards (PCB) of both hardware devices used in the examples are designed with free and open source software KiCAD that runs on GNU/Linux distributions.                The focus of the presentation will be on the open source software that implements an MQTT client, connects to an open source MQTT broker such as Mosquitto and controls the lights of RGB LED strip through PWM. The exact steps for the integration of new devices in Home Assistant using MQTT will be revealed in details.

We were asked to make it possible to                let the smartphone app connect to the IP gateway from anywhere in the world.                This vendor's IP gateway hard- and software was based on the Mbed platform, so                they needed a solution that could fit within Mbed.</p>                <p>First of all, there are a lot of ways to make a device in a local network                accessible from anywhere in the world: SSH tunneling, port forwarding with                dynamic DNS,... Since our client wanted an open-source, secure, low-cost and                easy to set up solution that he could host himself, we opted to go for                Pagekite. However, since Mbed does not support OpenSSL, Linux sockets or                libev, the existing libpagekite C library was not an option to start from. So                we started to implement a Mbed flavour of the library ourselves, and decided                to make it open-source</p>",

On one hand it needs some very specific configurations (e.g. which train stations do you use, so it can guestimate your arrival time, and therefore know when to control the heating or put the kettle on), and on the other it needs custom code to reflect your lifestyle. This latter point extends into the conversation of self-awareness of your own living patterns, and how they can be quantified.</p>                <p>He'll also comment on AI and service platforms (like Nest) which contain lessons for all IoT products.</p>",

Many of them will interact with cloud-based solutions to provide additional services on the devices or in the web. To bring IoT to the next level technologies for supporting cross-domain/cross-vendor solutions are needed. There is already a lot FOSS available to provide a technological base for building IoT solutions (e.g. Kubernetes). However, on top of it, software is needed for the connectivity challenges, support of domain-specific protocols, large scale messaging and device management and integration with existing infrastructure. Eclipse IoT aims to address these needs and provide an FOSS IoT framework that makes IoT development fast and simple. In the last year Eclipse IoT has made a lot of progress and the underlying environment in cloud technology has seen a lot of changes.

Different communication schemes will be discussed together with the trade-offs for aspects like energy consumption and down-link latency. We show how the simple but powerful API (based on file operations) allows to approach a network like a distributed database which you can address based on data queries instead of using node addresses.

                "abstract": "<p>The Pronto Raster library is a C++ library for Map Algebra operations. Map Algebra is a long established conceptual framework for geographical data analysis. It is a versatile and highly generic framework, classifying local, focal, and zonal operations. However existing libraries and tools that implement Map Algebra operations are not as generic and instead of a limited set of specific functions. The Pronto Raster library aims to overcome this and provides an efficient computational framework that allows efficient implementation of local, focal and zonal operations using user-specified functions.</p>                <p>The library uses GDAL to access and write raster data. A central concept of the library is the Raster, which is essentially a Range that iterates over the cells in a raster of values. The core focal and zonal operations produce Expression Templates that model the Raster concept. Therefore the outcome of zonal or focal operations on one or more Rasters is another Raster that does not hold data itself but refers to the data in the input rasters and combines the data lazily once the outcome Raster is iterated over. It thus becomes possible to combine and nest operations on rasters without creating temporary files. An additional benefit is that it is trivial to apply functions to only compute a subsection of the output Raster, which in turn makes the library very amenable to future parallelization.</p>",

                "description": "<p><a href=\"http://grass.osgeo.org\">GRASS GIS</a> has been existing for over 30 years by now and provides a very large and diverse set of state-of-the-art tools for the analysis of spatial data. Less known by many, remote sensing tools have been part of it almost from the beginning. GRASS GIS provides a <a href=\"https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/imageryintro.html\">series of imagery analysis tools</a> for pre-processing (radiometric correction, cloud detection, pansharpening, etc), creating derived indices (vegetation indices, texture analysis, principal components, fourier transform, etc), classifying (management of training zones, different classifiers, validation tools), and producing other derived products such as evapotranspiration and energy balance models. Next to these tools for satellite images, other tools exist for the handling of aerial photography for <a href=\"https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Orthorectification_digital_camera\">creation of orthophotos</a>, and for the import and analysis of <a href=\"https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/LIDAR\">Lidar data</a>.</p>                <p>In addition to these tools, efforts have gone into integrating current state-of-the-art methods such as object-based image analysis and machine learning. A <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/4/358/htm\">complete toolchain</a> exists to segment images using different algorithms, to create superpixels, to collect statistics characterizing the resulting objects, and to apply machine learning algorithms for classification. New modules also include unsupervised segmentation parameter optimization and active learning. Options for pixel-based classification have also been enlarged to a host of machine learning algorithms.</p>                <p>A specific aspect of treating the rapidly increasing amounts of satellite data is the scalability of tools. GRASS GIS has a long tradition of computational efficiency and work is continuously ongoing to increase both computational speed and the handling of huge datasets. Most relevant tools provide the choice to treat data either completely in memory, if enough RAM is available, or with a disk-based tiling scheme that allows treating data much larger than available memory resources would otherwise allow. Through its modular structure, GRASS GIS also allows to easily parallelize certain operations, thus opening the door to the use of cluster/grid computing environments.</p>                <p>The presentation will provide a brief, general introduction to the state of GRASS GIS development, focusing on the recent release of version 7.4. It will then provide an overview of the different elements in the remote sensing toolbox of GRASS GIS. It will end with an explanation of how these tools can be used in grid/cluster computing environments, demonstrated through an example of processing large time series of satellite data.</p>",

There are related platforms out there, but some of them are lacking good User Experience, others are not community lead or are getting away from the free software freedoms due to their paerships with companies that do not respect our privacy online. These are only some of the reasons the CityZen app was born in Tirana, as an OSM based Android app that helps us navigate our cities without tracking our location and activities. At the same time the app offers easy mobile optimized OpenStreetMap editing for easy contributions on the go.                CityZen aims to be empowered by the community in terms of development and promotion and as a digital wallet for cryptocurrency used to make payments for goods and services from POIs easily through the app. Soon CityZen will apply blockchain as a decentralized process for the management of the cryptocoin based revenue that will be gathered through the app making it one of the few platforms out there used to help you find physical POIs and buy goods without giving away your real identity.</p>",

Care will be made to not be too judgemental or divisive, but the session will make factual observations about the strengths and weaknesses about each example. Those strengths and weaknesses will focus on both the benefits and problems <em>technically</em> to the project (ie. how well it helps projects put together good code), and <em>socially</em> (ie. how well it helps projects be sustainable communities of hopefully happy people).</p>                <p>It will be the speakers conclusion that both democratic and dictatorial models are ultimately flawed and neither scale well, nor actually provide an engaging environment for new contributors to join a long established project.</p>                <p>The session will then present a model that focuses on the empowerment of contributors, \"those that do, decide\", explaining how such a model has long, ancient roots in the origins of many open source projects.                The talk will briefly hypothesise why the model is rarely found in distribution projects today, but present in some detail the core principles which Open Source projects should embrace from this philosophy, and (using openSUSE as an example), explain how to establish a healthy series of checks and balances to ensure a community following this model is both self sustainable, and relatively insulated to the problems with more democratic or dictatorial governance models often cause over time.</p>",

I will talk about the                motivations behind creating BuildStream, how it has been helping us                so far, and how the rich feature set we've created can help software                developers and integrators.</p>",

As a                result, the build metadata created for building for one platform                cannot normally be reused for another target, and upstream maintainers                typically need to maintain various sets of build metadata to get                their software out to users on different platforms.</p>                <p>One of our goals in BuildStream is to reduce the redundancy of                build metadata overall, by providing a declarative format and                build system which allows one to model build pipelines flexibly,                allowing the same build metadata to be leveraged to perform different                tasks.</p>                <p>Another goal for us is to bring the software developer and the                integrator closer together. By providing a workflow where the                developer of a single module is easily capable of testing their                changes against an integrated system, or an integrator can easily                change a line of code at any level of the stack and quickly test                the integrated result, we hope to bridge the gap between development                and integration.</p>",

Nevertheless, developers still are expected to provide exactly that - depending on the nature and lifetime of an application.

This talk is about how Cygwin is able to run Gentoo Prefix these days - which itself does run on multiple Unix/Linux operating systems on one hand, and some wrapper around the Microsoft Visual Studio toolchain - called Parity, providing a commandline interface similar to the (more popular) MinGW toolchain on the other hand.</p>",

All the applications and the libraries they require, together with Plasma, KDE's desktop environment that is the default and only option for Chakra, are updated continuously.</p>                <p>Our experience so far has shown that the half-rolling release model can fit into a variety of user profiles. Chakra's user base includes casual users, enthusiasts, developers, gamers, small businesses, and school labs. We believe other distributions could benefit from similar implementations.</p>                <p>Whether you are a user or a developer, your distribution's choice of release model can affect your options, workflow and system's status. This talk is intended to inform those looking for alternatives to the traditional fully rolling or standard release models that the majority of distributions adopt and learn more on the possibilities provided by the half-rolling release model.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Information leakage via side channels is a widely recognized threat to cyber security. In particular small devices are known to leak information through physical channels, i.e. power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, and timing behaviour.                Several implementation techniques and countermeasures are arising nowadays against this kind of threats, but still only fully equipped testing labs with skilled people can afford to test new implementations against leakage attacks.                The LADA project (University of Bristol, Cryptography Research Group) aims at bringing the skill of a testing lab to the desk of a developer of standard consumer devices, without the need for domain specific knowledge.                In such context I focused on the information leakages that are due to the execution time and investigated 'bit-slicing' as a possible countermeasure. I then started the design of a tool for LLVM (an LLVM pass) that works on the intermediate representation and that can transform the selected parts of the code into an equivalent 'bit-sliced' version.                Bit-slicing is just one of many features that can be added to LLVM in order to improve the security of the code.                Since my work is still in progress, the aim of my talk is to discuss the design of my tool, explain its limits and how it should be used, but also to collect any ideas about other security features that may be added to LLVM.</p>",

The outlining algorithm can be summarized by the following steps:-              To reduce the size of the tree, we can eliminate ASTs that won’t match anything else in a first pass (that is, if you don’t care about matching sub trees anyway). A hashing scheme that would store pointers to trees. Two trees would be in the same bucket if they could possibly match. They would be in different buckets if they definitely cannot match (like a bloom filter kind of setup). Then we can flatten the trees in each bucket, use the outlining technique there, and then end up with a factorization that way.              (1) Construct every AST.              (2) Say two ASTs “could be equal” if they are isomorphic to each other.              (3) Bucket each ASTs based off the “could be equal” scheme.              (4) For each bucket with more than one entry, flatten out the ASTs and run the outlining technique on the trees. At the end of each iteration, throw out the suffix tree built to handle the bucket.              Here the main point to note here is that we are eliminating AST which won’t match anything, this reduces a large number of ASTs in memory. We are using a fast subtree isomorphism algorithm for matching ASTs which takes O((k^(1.5)/logk) n ) , where k and n are the numbers of nodes in two ASTs.              For Tree pruning we are using the exploded graph concept to find the execution path when an externally defined function is called, focussing only on the variables or instructions which are affected as a result of that function call. We find like these all paths where an external function call is there, we keep these paths/branches in AST and eliminate all other branches of AST thereby reducing size of AST.</p>              <p>References              [1]http://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-03//assets/slides/cross<em>translation</em>unit<em>analysis</em>in<em>clang</em>static_analyzer.pdf              [2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AWgaqvFsgs              [3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yorld-WSOeU&amp;t=1060s</p>",

However, programming requires learning new programming languages and integrating additional compilers into the build system, making it difficult to use. Since LLVM supports GPU targets, it makes sense to extend an existing compiler. DCompute is an extension of LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler. This allows the user to write OpenCL and CUDA kernels in D. In this talk, I show what steps were necessary to integrate not only the code generation for conventional CPUs but also the code generation for GPUs. I also look at where the use of LLVM could be improved and which challenges still exist in LLVM.</p>",

                "description": "<p>In 2014, Jordan Rose and John McCall from Apple presented a talk about using                Clang to call C functions from foreign languages. They showed issues they had                doing it, especially about dealing with various ABI.</p>                <p>DragonFFI provides a way to easily call C functions and manipulate C structures                from any language. Its purpose is to parse C libraries headers without any                modifications and transparently use them in a foreign language, like Python or                Ruby. In order to deal with ABI issues previously demonstrated, it uses Clang                to generate scalar-only wrappers of C functions. It also uses generated debug                metadata to have introspection on structures.</p>                <p>Here is an example of the Python API:</p>                <pre><code>$ python                &gt;&gt;&gt; import pydffi                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib = pydffi.FFI()                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.cdef(\"#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\", [\"puts\"])                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.puts(\"Hello world!\")                Hello world!                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.compile(\"int foo(int a) { puts(\"hi!\"); return a+1; }\")                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.foo(4)                hi!                5                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.cdef(\"struct A { int a; short b; }\")                &gt;&gt;&gt; C = lib.A(a=4,b=5)                &gt;&gt;&gt; print(C.a,C.b)                4,5                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.compile('void dump(struct A* obj) { printf(\"From C: %d %d\\n\", obj-&gt;a, obj-&gt;b\"); }')                &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.dump(C)                From C: 4, 5                </code></pre>                <p>A high-level API provides the easy loading of a C library, that uses the                previous API under the hood:</p>                <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lib = pydffi.LoadLibrary(\"/lib/libc.so.6\",                headers=[\"stdio.h\",\"stdlib.h\"],              defines=[], include_paths=[])              &gt;&gt;&gt; lib.puts(\"Hello FFI!\")              Hello FFI!              </code></pre>              <p>This talk will present the tool, how Clang and LLVM are used to provide these              functionalities, and the pros and cons against what other similar libraries              like (c)ffi [0] [1] are doing.

                "abstract": "<p>A typical LLVM backend consists of complex passes lowering LLVM IR into valid and efficient machine code (MC). Complexity of the translation process originates from the inherent gap between LLVM IR and any mainstream instruction set architecture (ISA). Processors and their ISAs have been designed historically to be programmed by human assembly developers. Recent ISAs gained more complex features based on hardware considerations. To date, ISAs are designed with no respect for the IR of compilers. Hence, translation between IR and MC keeps being a complicated task.                What about lifting the target machine to meet LLVM Assembly instead of lowering LLVM IR to meet an unrelated ISA? A lifted target machine can simplify backend development. One may wonder, however, what else can be gained from such an endeavor? The answers to these questions might be relevant for those who are interested in hardware architectures and likewise for those working with compiler and application development.                This talk reveals how we realize a processor whose ISA is tailor-made to suit LLVM IR; what we expect from a rich ISA matching LLVM Assembly; and how we plan to utilize this technology to implement a multi-purpose architecture for IoT devices.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Imsys is a Swedish semiconductor SME with its proprietary processor architecture. Imsys processors provide a flexible, low-cost, and energy-efficient platform thanks to a microprogrammable microarchitecture implemented in the hardware core, which enables dynamic soft-reconfiguration as well.                Imsys processor cores are small and energy-efficient by design as the architecture is mostly implemented in dense, low-power, read-only memory rather than in logic circuits. Operations are defined at a relatively high level of abstraction and coded in a way which results in an efficient utilization of the different parts of the core. Hence, silicon area and power consumption are minimized.                The basic instruction set architecture (ISA) implemented in microcode is extensible with domain-specific instructions. Microcoded operations for signal processing and cryptographic features are already available for integration as special instructions or autonomous background processes in any ISA. That makes it possible to compile high-level software to an efficiently executed small footprint binary application.                A new generation of processors is currently being developed with an ISA designed specifically for LLVM. ISAL, the Imsys ISA for LLVM, provides a set of instructions matching LLVM Assembly. Besides easing the development of a corresponding LLVM backend, the tailor-made rich ISA is expected to (1) provide outstanding code density and (2) propagate software complexity into highly efficient microcode implementation of ISAL instructions. Therefore, the LLVM toolchain can easily turn high-level software into high efficiency binary code with respect to memory footprint, execution time, and energy consumption. That can be done without worrying about target-specific details since the step between LLVM IR and ISAL machine code is minimal.                The next generation Imsys processor featuring ISAL and a software ecosystem around it are planned to be released in 2018.                The proposed lightning talk provides a brief insight into how it is possible with the help of microcoding to define ISAL so that it meets LLVM IR. Our driving incentives in selecting this way of action are also discussed, especially considering how an ISA designed for LLVM helps exploiting inherent characteristics of our processor technology in order to make the platform appealing in the IoT market.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The number of free-software fonts has exploded since 2011, thanks primarily to CSS webfont services like Google Fonts and Open Font Library. But open fonts have yet to make gains in document-creation systems beyond web pages. This is attested to by the lack of open fonts used in other service types and communities of practice, including print-on-demand publishing, print-on-demand merchandise, eReaders and EPUB generation, games, and even in the default fonts bundled into binary packages of free-software applications like LibreOffice.</p>                <p>This talk will look at the obstacles, bottlenecks, and disconnects that have prevented open fonts from reaching the hands of users beyond the CSS @font-face directive. These issues include missing or proprietary-format source files, licensing cruft, the user experience of discoverability and installation, build tools for font binaries, and character coverage.</p>                <p>We will also discuss solutions, including what distributions and upstream application projects can do to mitigate these issues as well as what the broader free-software community can do to advocate for the usage of free-software fonts in documents and display typography outside of the browser window.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Libre Graphics magazine spent five years showing off excellent work done with Free/Libre and Open Source graphics software. Our aim when we started was to challenge the idea that F/LOSS tools weren’t up to the job of doing professional graphic design work, especially in print. We published eight issues of a beautifully-printed, tactile, keepable paper magazine. We showed off the work of individuals and small studios doing exciting work with F/LOSS tools.</p>                <p>In the two years since we stopped making Libre Graphics magazine, a lot of exciting things have happened in the world of F/LOSS design. But one of the problems that keeps hanging on is the perception of F/LOSS graphics tools as somehow something less-than or other-than the “industry standard” set of tools that graphic designers are meant to use.

However, when animating interfaces is important to consider the spatial model that is created by animations. Otherwise, it can lead to contradictions that make an interface more instead of less confusing. This talk introduces semantic animation, a way of designing interfaces that avoids contraditions by thinking about interfaces as a collection of components rather than a series of screens.</p>",
                "description": "<p>Animation is the future of interface design. It enables us to make interfaces more understandable by offloading processes from the user’s brain to the screen. However, in many cases animations are simply added as transitions between independently designed screens. This can result in animations contradicting each other spatially. I co-wrote an <a href=\"https://alistapart.com/article/motion-with-meaning-semantic-animation-in-interface-design\">article</a> about why this is a problem, and outlined a solution: Designing semantic components which change over time, and then using these to compose interfaces.</p>                <p>The industry seems to largely agree that this is the way forward, but there are very few interfaces implementing these ideas in a holistic way. I believe the main reason for this is that the current generation of toolkits and layout technologies is built for static layouts with strict hierarchies. This makes it prohibitively difficult to build interfaces where components move fluidly between different states.</p>                <p>I will talk about some of the challenges designing and implementing semantic animation both in prototypes and real-world applications, and give some general guidance on how you can make your applications more semantic.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Teleport is an app for quickly sending files on the local network.</p>                <p>Sadly, sharing files between two computers in the same room is still an unsolved problem in 2017. Of course there's USB keys, shared network folders, cloud storage services, and messaging apps, but they all have severe drawbacks in terms of speed, privacy, or user experience. The Apple ecosystem has AirDrop to cover this use case, but there is nothing comparable to it on GNU/Linux.</p>                <p>That's what Teleport is trying to fix: It offers a dead-simple interface for what should be a dead-simple task: Open the app on both machines, choose a file, the receiver gets a notification, the file is sent.</p>                <p>Unlike many FOSS apps, Teleport is design-driven. A designer was involved from the very beginning, and the entire app is built around providing a great end-user experience.</p>                <p>Teleport is a fully native GTK+3 app written in C, and integrates seamlessly with the GNOME desktop. Thanks to Flatpak, you can already use it on most GNU/Linux distributions [1].</p>              <p>I'll talk about my journey building this app (my first GTK app) from scratch, my collaboration with Tobias Bernard, the designer on the project, and my experience with the documentation and developer tools for the GNOME platform.</p>              <p>[1] http://frac-tion.com/teleport-flatpak</p>",

I also plan to have a number of the UWE Sense modules for people to look at, there is an App that that they can download, which talks to the sensors and logs dat to an open cloud infrastructure. The App is not developed in Rust, Nativescript is used, but the software for the sensors is. I don't plan to talk in detail about this part of our work, but I can provide links to our website and our paers, which will be launched in December 2017, and links to the software repos.</p>                <p>Full disclosure: UWE Audio is a reasonably new project and while we have a working system it would be misleading to say it is a complete project. For example, as our hardware platform has two ARM micro-processors, one for the control domain and one for the audio/cv domain our current compiler produces to Rust programs that are compiled separately and flashed to the devices. Our long term goal is to have the controller deploy DSP graphs to the audio processor dynamically via a Rust based API, simply in concept to OpenCL, but we are still quite a long way from reaching that final goal. That being said the project has been driven from the start with the goal of investigating Rust as an alternative to C for embedded programming and it's particular application in the audio domain and for this I believe it would be an interesting talk at FOSDEM.</p>",

If at all, standard distributions support only a small number of them explicitly, which leads to a lot of board specific images and distributions. This talk will show how this situation can be improved, to the point where off-the-shelf Linux (or BSD) distributions can be installed on those boards, without those distros knowing about each and every one of them. Key ingredients are standardized firmware interfaces like UEFI, stable device trees and on-board memory like SPI flash.                This should make using ARM based SBCs as easy as using (x86) PCs today: like \"real computers\".                On top of this ways to simplify and speed up mainline Linux kernel support are explored. Enabling kernel support for new SoCs usually takes a while, especially if the effort is driven by the community. This delays distribution support, up to a point where a certain SoC or board might become slightly dated when it's finally supported. Using more device tree features and less hardcoded kernel data would reduce the code required to support new SoCs, ideally reaching a point where new SoCs could be at least booted with existing (distribution!) kernels, just by providing the proper device tree blob.                This talk describes the idea and gives an example by looking at what can be done on Allwinner SoCs.</p>",

LinuxBoot improves boot reliability by replacing lightly-tested firmware drivers with hardened Linux drivers.                LinuxBoot improves boot time by removing unnecessary code, resulting in a 20x faster boot time (typical value).                LinuxBoot allows customization of the initrd runtime to support site-specific needs (both device drivers as well as custom executables).                LinuxBoot and its precursors are a proven approach for almost 20 years in military, consumer electronics, and supercomputing systems – wherever reliability and performance are paramount.</p>                <p>This talk replaces the talk \"SITL bringup with the IIO framework\" by Bandan Das</p>",

This was not only running some tests on the code; since the students have total freedom on the language and other aspects of their project, it had to check things that went from the presence of some files to the use of GitHub issues for organization of the tasks.                This was eventually solved with a Perl script that tested every pull request made by students. And this has had a number of interesting and mostly positive side effects on the student behavior and performance, which will be examined and presented in this presentation, where I will do no theater and dress with a single tee. Promised.                Take home message is one that I have trying to drive home since the beginning, when I was talking about how Perl saved a conference I was organizing: Perl is an incredible tool for automating simple tasks that nobody thought could actually be automated; and automating things has many implications for the automator and the automatees; so Perl and daily life are always interesting and winning combinations.</p>",

Over that                time, it has become an important building block for configuration                management tools like Puppet and Salt, and is used by tools such as EFF's                Let's Encrypt, OSQuery, and libvirt.</p>                <p>I will talk about some of the basic patterns for using Augeas to perform                surgery on configuration files, share some tips on how to get the most out                of its tree structure, and how to use it to perform idempotent changes.

This talk aims to describe the journey a systems engineer had as part of an automation assignment with the network management team. Building from lessons learned and challenges faced with system automation, how one can kickstart an automation project and gain small wins quickly. Where and how to start the journey?  What to avoid? What to prioritise?  How to overcome the lack of network skills for the automation engineer and lack of automation and Linux/Unix skills for network engineers. What challenges were faced and how to overcome them? What fights to give up?  Where do I see network automation and configuration management as a systems engineer?

The GDPR is not only multinational corporations’ concern any more. Individuals and small entrepreneurs are looking for the answers too. This makes space for speculations and many partial solutions are offered in a form of a GDPR project draft templates or migration of processing into the new safe environment without appropriate paperwork. Even software solutions usually offer only partial safety measures and you will need a bunch of them to fulfill the GDPR project.                A complete solution exists only as cooperation of legal person analyzing interpretation of EU legislative and IT technician able to incorporate those requirements into daily operations. The complete solution still does not mean 100% compliance because there are so many threats you can never be utterly safe from.                This presentation will tell what you must not omit to be compliant, how to give effects to the rights of data subjects and how to craft your GDPR solution. We will discuss lawful basis for data processing, consent requirements and tools able to manage them effectively. In the end, we may think about the design of identity management tool that combines the advantages of identity management into one solution dealing with various GDPR issues.                Included GDPR areas in light of Identity management: Lawful basis and consent management, risk assessment, data breach tool, DPO’s control tool and data subject’s rights control tool.</p>",

Our strategy is based on providing hands-on material and training courses first, instead of starting issuing \"official\" but impractical process guides. Our current focus is on knowledge sharing between peer scientists using online tools as well as face-to-face workshops. Thereby collected findings and feedback from DLR scientists have proven to be helpful to improve existing documentation and to identify further steps. Our strategy is based on years of experience and permanently updating and extending our initial approach. We want to share the so gained knowledge with other projects, rearchers, and companies to help the Open Source communities found there to improve.</p>",

Same goes for the terms of use of our favourite Git hosting service, translation tool, you name it.</p>                <p>One thing that makes things very easy for adult developers is that we are legally able to accept just about anything that might be written in such terms - but at least one subgroup of developers can't: children younger than a certain age limit.</p>                <ul>                <li>All US based websites are legally forced to prohibit registration by people younger than 13 years (simply put)</li>                <li>German children are not allowed to accept any terms that cut legal rights they normally have</li>                <li>…</li>                </ul>                <p>If any free software project has children as a target group, we (the people at Teckids e.V.) strongly believe it should make contributions by minors as easy as its usage. This involves caring about all legal documents that might get in the way.</p>                <p>In this podium, we would like to raise some awareness and discuss experiences, ideas, possibilities, and the like in order to make the FOSS world a good place for everyone, independent of their age.</p>",

In response to that talk, Github made some                important improvements. How are they doing now, and what about other                sites and systems where users frequently obtain software, like Google                Play, the Chrome Web Store, and the Firefox Add-ons library? Too often                we find that such sites do not display license information at all in                key places, or if they do, it's in a way that is not as clear or as                strong as many of us in the free software movement would like to see.                How can users prefer free software when they aren't given the info                they need to choose it?

We tried to use art. 69 as a legal hack to make available the source code of publicly financed whistleblowing software, from some municipalities and publicly controlled companies.

Because it includes dependency data, it can tell us not only about numeric usage, but also about relative importance and position in the stack of various licenses; and since it has a notion of \"stack\" (tied to repositories) it can inform some of our intuitions about how license usage varies by stack. We'll use this to assess</p>                <p>(The biggest shortcoming of the Libraries.io data is that, because there are no \"repos\" per se, it does not cover C/C++/core operating system components; I'll also discuss this in the talk.)</p>                <p>After discussing the current state of copyleft using data, we'll discuss what the future of copyleft might look like. This discussion will be informed by the data, but not limited to the data. Among other things, I'll discuss the theoretical value of copyleft in a world where FOSS has \"won\", indicated demand for copyleft in the culture and data space (e.g., institutional paers pushing for data in CC 4 &amp; CDLA; interest in non-licensing solutions), License Zero, the legal challenges of copyleft in the SaaS space, and the growing concerns about developer sustainability. [Tidelift, my company, is working in this sustainability space, but obviously I'll avoid making the talk a pitch for the company.]</p>                <p>I will likely conclude (contingent on some further data analysis) that there continues to be interest and demand for copyleft, but that a major driver of the perceived (and in some cases very real) decline of GPL + friends is a result of the inadequacy of our current copyleft legal tools. My hope is that this will be a call to action to the community to continue innovating around copyleft.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Fonts sit at a peculiar crossroads in the software license-compliance world. They contain executable instructions as well as static, visual data. They are binary files that, even when \"open\", are often shipped without source code. They are sensitive to namespace collision problems but are only exposed in user interfaces by name. The files themselves are governed by copyright, but the design they encode is not considered copyrightable in the US and other jurisdictions. Furthermore, the typemaking industry has long vacillated on the appropriateness of reviving, reusing, and extending earlier works as new designs.</p>                <p>This talk provides an overview of the intellectual-property law and the community norms that concern sharing, reusing, and extending typeface designs. It highlights several specific issues relevant to modern digital font projects:</p>                <p>• The law has struggled to keep up with industry practices on the subject of copying a competitor's type design. In the cold-metal era, foundries routinely copied and sold designs originating from the competition, even mechanically reproducing metal type in bulk. When digital fonts arrived in the 20th Century, the files themselves were originally not regarded as intellectual property, and wholesale copying picked up once again. Today, the files are considered copyrighted, but the designs are not. This can leave users in an uncertain position, as modern tools allow designs to be copied digitally, without copying the original file, and the law has not drawn clear lines around what practices are permissible.                • Reviving a historical typeface is generally considered an acceptable practice if the design process begins with primary materials (such as metal types, proofs, or out-of-copyright prints). There is fierce disagreement, however, about how far in the past a designer must go before a typeface is considered fair game; revivals of typefaces that were \"works for hire\" by a corporate foundry or printer in particular are controversial because ownership of the intellectual property is debatable. Moreover, there is disagreement about how the original designers of a typeface can and should be credited in a revival, particularly when the revival makes alternations and updates. Users need to be particularly aware of these issues when selecting typefaces for branding and advertising purposes, which can attract public criticism.                • Font names can attract more attention than the visual design itself, for the simple reason that installed fonts are, traditionally, searchable and accessible on computer systems only by their name. Name collisions between fonts are increasingly common, yet little effort has gone into addressing these collisions through trademark law.                • The leading license used for free-software fonts, the SIL Open Font License (OFL), is often misunderstood, and those misunderstandings can place developers and users of open fonts in a bind on compliance issues. For example, the OFL does not require source-code availability, but it does include restrictions limiting the circumstances under which the fonts can be sold. It also includes an optional clause that, at the licensor's discretion, requires users to change the user-visible name of the font if any alteration is made to the binary, including common practices like subsetting the font to deliver it over the web. Downstream projects that user OFL-licensed fonts and assume that the OFL is broadly compatible with common free-software licenses may not be aware when license-compliance problems occur.</p>                <p>There are no easy answers for resolving these issues in free software, but this talk will provide developers and communities with advice for identifying and coping with licensing issues relating to the fonts that they utilize in their projects.</p>",

It is designed to deliver a development experience similar to desktop UI frameworks, abstracting away the underlying web technologies. If JavaScript support is unavailable, it will even fall back to plain HTML automatically. This allows C++ developers to quickly develop highly interactive applications. Because it's written in C++, Wt is especially well-suited for embedded platforms.</p>                <p>Wt 4, released in September 2017, updates its API to use C++11. The result is that the API of Wt 4 is more clear and exception safe, relies on fewer Boost dependencies, and compiles faster.</p>                <p>This talk will be an introduction to Wt 4 for C++ programmers. We will show how to make a \"hello world\"-style web application with Wt, and demonstrate some selected features of Wt. By the end of the talk, the audience should have enough knowledge to get started with Wt 4. No knowledge of older versions of Wt is required.</p>",

No one had prior knowledge on robotics.</p>                <p>By studying the market and other startups, we realized the common mistake is to use \"robotic modules\" as building blocks. They are highly expensive, provide little bang for buck, often are inefficient, and require complex software middleware (such as ROS) as the glue inbetween.</p>                <p>Due to our combined background in mechanical, electrical, software and manufacturing design, we took the approach of designing as much as possible by ourselves.</p>                <p>A Bill-of-Materials example: instead of spending $100 on a BLDC motor driver module, our $100 main PCB integrates two such motor controllers - and a 100W li-ion charger, 5V 10A power supply, MEMS compass, accelerometer, two 3-axis gyroscopes, power IO, and a powerful microcontroller.</p>                <p>Having low-level calculation resources available right where the sensor data is first acquired means good data synchronization, low-latency reaction, and this simplifies the higher level software requirements. We actually love the power of embedded!</p>                <p>During the process, we found out that we simply don't need ROS - we already solved most of the puzzle on the lowest level possible, simply and efficiently.</p>                <p>It's often said that it's hard and slow to develop custom HW/SW from scratch. This has clearly not been the case: it took us 4 months from total zero to completely design all the electronics, embedded software, simple prototype Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) software, etc., to build the first actual prototype that could autonomously explore its surroundings, perform navigation tasks, and find its own charger. At that point, we thought about the open source business model, established the company, thinking: this is too good to keep in our own basement.</p>                <p>The code footprint for embedded, higher level backend, and user interface frontend is currently 30 000 lines total.</p>                <p>We still have a long way to go. We are now selling the very first generation of robots for the early adopters, hoping to give a kick start to the open source community as soon as possible. Behind the curtains, we are focusing on the development of our next 3D sensor system, which will replace the current scanning 2D lidar with a 360x90 degree full 3D distance data, and do it for the same price we currently pay for the Scanse 2D lidar used in the first small-scale production batch.</p>",

The goal is not necessarily to implement the autonomous feature ourselves, but to allow users to do it by either modify the firmware or add and external computer such as a Raspberry Pi or OpenMV to to add autonomous driving features.</p>                <p>The hardware is open and was designed with FOSS tools such as Kicad and FreeCAD. It’s made of a PCB that act as the frame of the car, 3D printed parts, off the shelf parts from pololu.com (battery, motors, sensors) and and Crazyflie 2.0 nano drone. The drone (without its motors) is connected to the O’PAVES board using an extension port. This solution makes the platform easy to build because most of the very small electronic assembly is already done on the drone. The software is developed in Ada and also only uses FOSS tools like the GNAT compiler or the Ada<em>Drivers</em>Library. The project is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/adacore/opaves</p>                <p>In this 25 minutes talk I want to present the state of the project, explain how you can build and hack the platform and show some of the tools and techniques that we used to develop the project.

Finally, systems with limited resources and multi-stage booting is discussed. The talk includes examples and experiences from platforms recently added to mainline U-Boot.</p>",
                "description": "<p>This presentation is a practical guide to implementing U-Boot port to a new system from scratch. U-Boot is the de-facto standard bootloader for embedded systems, there is plenty of U-Boot ports, yet vast majority of those are implemented in sub-optimal way. This talk first explains the U-Boot internals, the driver model (DM) and it's interaction with device tree (DT), as understanding these is vital to understanding the implementation of core subsystems. The core subsystems are explained in detail afterward to allow developers implement drivers the intended way without hacks and workarounds. Unfortunately, not all systems have plenty of resources, but U-Boot caters for those as well. The final part of the talk discusses the U-Boot SPL, the preloader which initializes the hardware, DRAM and starts U-Boot and finer parts of this procedure, which tends to have plenty of pitfalls.</p>",

The character device brings in many new interesting features such as: polling for line events, finding GPIO chips and lines by name, changing &amp; reading the values of multiple lines with a single ioctl (one context switch) and many more.

                "description": "<p>If you work in open source, then it's increasingly likely that you've come across the Sphinx documentation tool. Originally written by and for the Python community, the past few years have seen an increasingly rapid adoption by non-Python projects. Recent adopters of Sphinx include the Linux kernel, Open vSwitch and the Dataplane Development Kit (DPDK), while other projects such as QEMU are preparing plans to migrate. Meanwhile, the Python ecosystem itself has only grown in strength and communities such as OpenStack have adopted the tool and have made extensive use of it.</p>                <p>Unfortunately, despite the widespread adoption and existence of multiple extensions, Sphinx is not always a very well understood tool. Extensions provide a pathway to greater functionality, for example, automatically generating documentation or generating docs in different output formats. Themes, meanwhile, provide a way to give a consistent, project-focused feel to your docs. The OpenStack community makes significant use of these extensibility features, which allow us to solve a number of problems in an automated manner.</p>                <ul>                <li>How can I avoid documenting a command line application twice: once in code and once in my docs?</li>                <li>How can I take a large dataset and automatically convert this into multiple human-readable documents?</li>                <li>How can I move documents about without breaking links?</li>                <li>How can I automatically spell-check my documents?</li>                <li>How can I style my docs to match my project website?</li>                </ul>                <p>Through this talk we will demonstrate how each of the above problems, and how many more, can be solved in an easy and automated manner through the power of Sphinx extensions and themes. We also demonstrate how you can share your extensions and themes with the world, if you're so inclined</p>",

                "description": "<p>Deciding where to store documentation, particularly for open source projects, can raise a number of questions. Do users or contributors need to read the docs offline? Do you keep a docs record for older versions, and if so, how and where do you store them, and how do you handle new releases? Is there a point where documentation content, versioning, style, and assets become too unweildy to store with code?</p>                <p>As a documentarian working on a number of open source projects, as well as providing site deployment support to even more, I’ve seen and tried a variety of strategies to answer these questions. I’ll share a handful of successful approaches, how they came about, and the pros and cons of each. Audience members will leave with guidelines for choosing the best “path” for docs in current and future open source projects.</p>                <p>This talk will look at process-type aspects (like considerations for reducing contributor friction), and the OSS tooling that can help address some of these considerations. All of it is in the context of documenting and working with open source projects.</p>                <p>As an example, you might decide that the actual docs website (generated with an open source site generator) is too bulky to store in the code repo (impacting clone times for new contributors). On the other hand, you might want to keep the text content of the docs in the code repo, because they can be accessed offline after cloning, and code-updating PRs can easily include corresponding docs updates. One option for handling this dual-repo setup is an open source tool called Markdown Magic, which can run during the site generator build, and pull marked content from code comments or markdown files in the main repo. I've actually used this setup myself, and can speak from experience about some of the conveniences, inconveniences, and gotchas to watch out for when using that tool/strategy.</p>",

Babelfish offers a foundation on which these tools can be built.</p>                <p>Babelfish aims to be a universal code parser that scales. Native parsers provided by each language ecosystem are used to get a native AST. This AST is then converted to a language-independent format that includes universal annotations for language features, which allows both a generic language-independent analysis and a more detailed language-specific analysis.</p>                <p>Language drivers are built on top of containers to allow easy deployment of many different languages in a generic way. An SDK is provided to develop these drivers, providing the annotation language, conversion tools, etc. A server is in charge of handling the different drivers, language detection, scaling the number of running instances, etc. Finally, libraries and clients for different languages are provided to give language analysts the needed foundation to be able to write the code analysis tools they want.</p>                <p>In this talk, we want to explain in more detail the architecture and components of Babelfish to reach both language analysists interested in building tools on top of it and potential contributors to the project.</p>",

                "description": "<p>Many companies have large software projects that have been developed over decades. Many times these projects use older technologies that may not support newer features that are wanted, and it may be difficult to hire resources that want to work with the older technologies. To solve these issues, sometimes companies decide to use a rules-based migration to convert their code base to a new language. Over the past 20 years, I have worked on several such migration projects and have developed SmaCC for such projects.</p>                <p>Creating a rules-based migrator is similar to normal software development. Instead of creating classes and methods, you create transformation rules. A typical migration project may need hundreds if not thousands of transformation rules. SmaCC supports both imperative, code-based, transformations as well as declarative, pattern-based, transformations. While an individual rule may be simple and easy to implement, there can be interactions between the rules that cause problems when running in a group. SmaCC provides support for debugging the rules. It has a custom debugger that knows about AST nodes and transformation rules, as well as a previewer that shows what rule changed a particular piece of code. Together all of these SmaCC features, from the AST generation to the custom debug support, allow me to more quickly migrate projects.</p>",

Instead of providing predefined tools, Moose focuses on moldable tools that enable programmers to create their own analyses. We can measure the cost of a custom analysis in terms of minutes, instead of days. This demo will show ways in which Moose can enable custom analyses.

                "description": "<p>For the past year we have been migrating all of our production servers running on bare-metal to system containers based on LXC/LXD as well as our production application from CentOS to Ubuntu.                Although we are already using containers for most of our systems, our production environment is still not quite there yet.                We have decided to start already the process of automating the deployment of our development environment, moving from a single shared development environment to a multitude of system containers, where developers have root access to their own containers making use of the flexibility, simplicity and security features provided by LXC and LXD.</p>                <p>In this presentation I will explain how we are using Jenkins/Bash/PyLXD for developers to create containers with a single click via Jenkins to a cluster of LXD servers and Puppet/Hiera/Bash to provision the containers after they are launched successfully in the LXD cluster.                If time allows it I will also show a quick demo of a container being created on our development environment.</p>",

                "description": "<p>The LXD daemon supports container migration. It supports non-live migration in which case the container's filesystem will be transferred in an optimized way. In addition to non-live migration LXD has been supporting live migration of containers. This means that volatile process information associated with a given container is migrated in addition to the filesystem. Part of this volatile information is the container's memory state at a given point in time. A container can either be live-migrated by dumping the memory state to disk once and transferring it or by performing a series of memory dumps that aim to minimize the delta between each consecutive dump in order to guarantee an optimized and more reliable way of transferring the container's memory state. This is achieved by making use of CRIU's pre-dump features. This talk will outline the steps that were taken to optimize filesystem and memory transfer when migrating container's between hosts.</p>",

There are many (specialized) tools to generate them.  If your organization needs a set of e.g. different distributions with the same packages installed and the same configuration, diskimage-builder might be the tool to choose: it can generate a wide range of different distributions (e.g. RedHat/CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSuse, Gentoo, ...) as a virtual machine or even docker images for a couple of architectures.  Images are known to run on a wide range of virtualization and cloud services, like OpenStack, VmWare, AWS EC2, OTC, KVM, docker (and even bare metal). diskimage-builder is highly configurable by means of 'elements': predefined and/or easy to write extensions.</p>                <p>The talk is a general (technical) introduction to diskimage-builder with a short in-depth chapter about the new block device layer like: images, loop devices, partitioning, lvm, mounting, fs, and fstab handling.</p>",

The GDPR aims primarily to give control back to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.
